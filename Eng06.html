        <p>We often hear the phrase, “Patience is a part of faith.” This originates from the words of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud (RA) as recorded in <i>Shu’ab al-Iman</i> 9083, and authenticated by Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalani (RH). However, the phrase “a part” can be misleading, as in English, it may imply an undefined portion rather than an equal division. The more accurate translation is “half.” The full hadith is as follows:</p>
<h4>الصَّبْرُ نِصْفُ الإِيمَانِ وَالْيَقِينُ الإِيمَانُ كُلُّهُ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“PATIENCE is half of faith, and CERTAINTY is faith in its entirety.”</b></p>
        <p>And this statement originates from the Verses of the Quran, where patience is paired with the other half of faith—gratitude. For instance, in Verse 31 of Surah Luqman, Allah (SWT) says:</p>
<h4>أَلَمۡ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱلۡفُلۡكَ تَجۡرِي فِي ٱلۡبَحۡرِ بِنِعۡمَتِ ٱللَّهِ لِيُرِيَكُم مِّنۡ ءَايَٰتِهِۦٓۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَأٓيَٰتࣲ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارࣲ شَكُورࣲ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Do you not see that the ships sail upon the sea by the grace of Allah, so that He may show you some of His signs? Indeed, in this are signs for those who are PATIENT and GRATEFUL.</b></p>
        <p>Then, there is also a hadith of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 35, which states that faith consists of more than seventy branches. How do we understand this? To make it clearer, let us use an analogy.</p>
        <p>Imagine faith as a planet within our hearts. At its very core lies certainty—without absolute certainty, the planet of faith cannot exist. Surrounding this core is the mantle, representing patience and gratitude, which form the foundation that upholds faith. Finally, on the crust or surface, the seventy-plus branches of faith are spread out, manifesting in various aspects of belief and practice.</p>
        <p>From this, we begin to understand the immense importance of patience in living a life of faith. Without patience, the perfection of faith cannot be attained. In fact, patience is a virtue placed at an exceptionally high rank, as Allah (AWJ) declares in Verse 10 of Surah Az-Zumar:</p>
<h4>إِنَّمَا يُوَفَّى ٱلصَّٰبِرُونَ أَجۡرَهُم بِغَيۡرِ حِسَابࣲ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Only those who are patient will be given their reward without limit.</b></p>
        <p>Not only that, but without patience, the core of certainty will begin to crack, the mantle of gratitude will weaken, and the branches of faith on the surface will erode. Without patience, the planet of faith will shatter. This aligns with the words of ‘Ali (RA) in <i>As-Sabr</i> by Ibn Abi Dunya 8:</p>
<h4>أَلَا إِنَّ الصَّبْرَ مِنَ الْإِيمَانِ بِمَنْزِلَةِ الرَّأْسِ مِنَ الْجَسَدِ فَإِذَا قُطِعَ الرَّأْسُ بَادَ الْجَسَدُ أَلَا إِنَّهُ لَا إِيمَانَ لِمَنْ لَا صَبْرَ لَهُ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Surely, patience in relation to faith is like the head to the body—if the head is severed, the body perishes. Indeed, there is no faith for the one who has no patience.”</b></p>
<h3>The Meaning: The Imagery of Sabr</h3>
        <p>Before delving into the hadith about patience being like grasping hot embers, we must first ensure we truly understand the meaning of “sabr.” A direct translation into English alone is insufficient, as modern languages lack the depth of the most precise language in the world. As explained in Verse 2 of Surah Yusuf, this is why the Quran was revealed in Classical Arabic—so that we may grasp its terms profoundly and apply them correctly in our lives.</p>
        <p>To fully grasp “sabr,” we must explore its linguistic depth in Arabic. Unlike most languages, where words are formed by combining letters and modified with prefixes and suffixes, Classical Arabic is built upon triliteral roots—three base letters that generate numerous interconnected words, each carrying its own meaning.</p>
        <p>For instance, the word <b>صَبْر</b>, derives from the root <b>ص ب ر</b>. Each letter holds significance: where <b>ص</b> signifies “consistency” or “homogeneity,” <b>ب</b> represents “medium” or “conveyance,” and <b>ر</b> implies “command” or “order.” Together, they convey the idea of “consistency that brings order”—the very essence of patience. Such depth of meaning is unparalleled in any other language.</p>
        <p>Arabic is a language of clarity, deeply rooted in real, observable scenarios. Unlike many other languages that rely on abstract terms, Arabic words capture vivid, tangible meanings. A single word can encapsulate entire descriptions, unfolding layers of imagery that other languages struggle to convey.</p>
        <p>The word <b>صَبْر</b> is a clear example. Among the words derived from its triliteral root is <b>صَابُورَة</b>—a ballast system in which heavy stones were placed beneath the deck of ancient Arab sailing vessels to maintain balance amid towering waves. This reflects the nature of patience: not only a force that stabilises faith, but one that prevents a person from being swept away by the turbulence of life.</p>
        <p>Another word originating from the same triliteral root is <b>صَبِرٌ</b>, which refers to the aloe plant, the extracted juice of certain bitter trees, and potent medicinal substances. Though intensely bitter, these were highly valued for their healing properties. From this, we understand its connection to the nature of “sabr”—a bitter experience to endure, yet profoundly beneficial; difficult to bear, yet essential for emotional and spiritual resilience.</p>
