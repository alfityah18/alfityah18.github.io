<h3>The Importance of Sabr</h3>
        <p>We often hear the phrase, “Patience is a part of faith.” This originates from the words of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud (RA) as recorded in <i>Shu’ab al-Iman</i> 9083, and authenticated by Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalani (RH). However, the phrase “a part” can be misleading, as in English, it may imply an undefined portion rather than an equal division. The more accurate translation is “half.” The full hadith is as follows:</p>
<h4>الصَّبْرُ نِصْفُ الإِيمَانِ وَالْيَقِينُ الإِيمَانُ كُلُّهُ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“PATIENCE is half of faith, and CERTAINTY is faith in its entirety.”</b></p>
        <p>And this statement originates from the Verses of the Quran, where patience is paired with the other half of faith—gratitude. For instance, in Verse 31 of Surah Luqman, Allah (SWT) says:</p>
<h4>أَلَمۡ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱلۡفُلۡكَ تَجۡرِي فِي ٱلۡبَحۡرِ بِنِعۡمَتِ ٱللَّهِ لِيُرِيَكُم مِّنۡ ءَايَٰتِهِۦٓۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَأٓيَٰتࣲ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارࣲ شَكُورࣲ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Do you not see that the ships sail upon the sea by the grace of Allah, so that He may show you some of His signs? Indeed, in this are signs for those who are PATIENT and GRATEFUL.</b></p>
        <p>Then, there is also a hadith of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 35, which states that faith consists of more than seventy branches. How do we understand this? To make it clearer, let us use an analogy.</p>
        <p>Imagine faith as a planet within our hearts. At its very core lies certainty—without absolute certainty, the planet of faith cannot exist. Surrounding this core is the mantle, representing patience and gratitude, which form the foundation that upholds faith. Finally, on the crust or surface, the seventy-plus branches of faith are spread out, manifesting in various aspects of belief and practice.</p>
        <p>From this, we begin to understand the immense importance of patience in living a life of faith. Without patience, the perfection of faith cannot be attained. In fact, patience is a virtue placed at an exceptionally high rank, as Allah (AWJ) declares in Verse 10 of Surah Az-Zumar:</p>
<h4>إِنَّمَا يُوَفَّى ٱلصَّٰبِرُونَ أَجۡرَهُم بِغَيۡرِ حِسَابࣲ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Only those who are patient will be given their reward without limit.</b></p>
        <p>Not only that, but without patience, the core of certainty will begin to crack, the mantle of gratitude will weaken, and the branches of faith on the surface will erode. Without patience, the planet of faith will shatter. This aligns with the words of ‘Ali (RA) in <i>As-Sabr</i> by Ibn Abi Dunya 8:</p>
<h4>أَلَا إِنَّ الصَّبْرَ مِنَ الْإِيمَانِ بِمَنْزِلَةِ الرَّأْسِ مِنَ الْجَسَدِ فَإِذَا قُطِعَ الرَّأْسُ بَادَ الْجَسَدُ أَلَا إِنَّهُ لَا إِيمَانَ لِمَنْ لَا صَبْرَ لَهُ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Surely, patience in relation to faith is like the head to the body—if the head is severed, the body perishes. Indeed, there is no faith for the one who has no patience.”</b></p>
<h3>The Imagery of Sabr</h3>
        <p>Before delving into the hadith about patience being like grasping hot embers, we must first ensure we truly understand the meaning of “sabr.” A direct translation into English alone is insufficient, as modern languages lack the depth of the most precise language in the world. As explained in Verse 2 of Surah Yusuf, this is why the Quran was revealed in Classical Arabic—so that we may grasp its terms profoundly and apply them correctly in our lives.</p>
        <p>To fully grasp “sabr,” we must explore its linguistic depth in Arabic. Unlike most languages, where words are formed by combining letters and modified with prefixes and suffixes, Classical Arabic is built upon triliteral roots—three base letters that generate numerous interconnected words, each carrying its own meaning.</p>
        <p>For instance, the word <b>صَبْر</b>, derives from the root <b>ص ب ر</b>. Each letter holds significance: where <b>ص</b> signifies “consistency” or “homogeneity,” <b>ب</b> represents “medium” or “conveyance,” and <b>ر</b> implies “command” or “order.” Together, they convey the idea of “consistency that brings order”—the very essence of patience. Such depth of meaning is unparalleled in any other language.</p>
        <p>Arabic is a language of clarity, deeply rooted in real, observable scenarios. Unlike many other languages that rely on abstract terms, Arabic words capture vivid, tangible meanings. A single word can encapsulate entire descriptions, unfolding layers of imagery that other languages struggle to convey.</p>
        <p>The word <b>صَبْر</b> is a clear example. Among the words derived from its triliteral root is <b>صَابُورَة</b>—a ballast system in which heavy stones were placed beneath the deck of ancient Arab sailing vessels to maintain balance amid towering waves. This reflects the nature of patience: not only a force that stabilises faith, but one that prevents a person from being swept away by the turbulence of life.</p>
        <p>Another word originating from the same triliteral root is <b>صَبِرٌ</b>, which refers to the aloe plant, the extracted juice of certain bitter trees, and potent medicinal substances. Though intensely bitter, these were highly valued for their healing properties. From this, we understand its connection to the nature of “sabr”—a bitter experience to endure, yet profoundly beneficial; difficult to bear, yet essential for physical, emotional, and spiritual resilience.</p>
        <p>Moreover, <b>صَبْرَةٌ</b>, which signifies strong stones or iron, reflects the resilience that emerges from the practice of patience. Just as stone and iron withstand external pressure without breaking, “sabr” fortifies an individual against life's trials. Through each hardship endured, a person grows stronger, much like metal tempered by fire. The more challenges one faces, the more one’s wisdom deepens, and one’s perseverance strengthens in confronting the trials ahead.</p>
        <p>In the daily lives of the ancient Arabs, farmers would amass vast quantities of grain—such as wheat—during harvest. The sheer volume was so immense that when heaped together, it remained unmeasured and unweighed, forming a towering heap known as <b>صُبْرَةٌ</b>. This term embodies vastness and immensity—analogous to the limitless reward of “sabr,” as mentioned earlier in Verse 10 of Surah Az-Zumar. Indeed, the hardships endured with patience are profoundly worthwhile.</p>
        <p>To conclude this section, livestock such as sheep, goats, and camels that instinctively return to their owners by dusk, following the same familiar path, are referred to as <b>أَصْبِرَةٌ</b>. This reflects the obedience inherent in the nature of “sabr.” Just as these animals return without hesitation to their owners, the devoted servants of Allah remain steadfast upon the straight path set by their Creator, always turning back to His guidance. Just as an owner cherishes the animals that remain loyal to them, Allah loves those who patiently persevere, as conveyed in Verse 146 of Surah aal-e-‘Imran.</p>
<h4>وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>And Allah loves the patient ones.</b></p>
<h3>The Seven Meanings of Sabr</h3>
        <p>Arabic is a language rich with layered meanings. A single word can branch out into multiple interpretations, each carrying its own tone, character, and function—yet all remain interconnected. To truly understand the concept of “sabr” in modern languages, we must first identify the seven meanings that emerge from its root. To do so, we will explore how each of these meanings is used in the Verses of the Quran.</p>
        <p>The first meaning is <b>PATIENCE</b>, defined as the ability to accept or tolerate difficult situations without becoming annoyed or anxious. This quality is essential when facing trials such as boredom, delays, disruptions, irritation, hardship, pain, suffering, and the like.</p>
        <p>It requires a person to calm the heart, as expressed in the saying of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ recorded in <i>Musnad Ahmad</i> 23122: <b>“Whoever succumbs to anxiety will suffer the harm that anxiety brings.”</b> It also calls for a sense of contentment with Divine decree, as demonstrated in the words of Prophet Jacob (AS) in Verse 18 of Surah Yusuf: <b>“So I shall bear this with beautiful PATIENCE”</b>—that is, a patience marked by inner calm and free from complaint, protest, or resentment.</p>
        <p>The second meaning is <b>ENDURANCE</b>, which refers to the ability to endure difficult or unpleasant processes or situations without giving up. This quality is vital when facing long, ongoing, or multifaceted trials—and serves to prove, preserve, and strengthen one’s faith and conviction.</p>
        <p>One example of this can be seen in Allah’s reassurance to Rasulullah ﷺ in Verse 34 of Surah al-An‘am: <b>Indeed, messengers before you were rejected, but they endured rejection and persecution until Our help came to them.</b> Similarly, in Verse 155 of Surah al-Baqarah, Allah (AWJ) says: <b>And We will surely test you with a touch of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives, and crops. But give glad tidings to those who ENDURE.</b></p>
        <p>The third meaning is <b>STEADFASTNESS</b>, that is, unwavering firmness of heart, mind, faith, conviction, principles, loyalty, obedience, purpose, resolve, and vision. This quality is marked by inner stability, consistency, and composure of soul, even in the face of all forms of hardship or opposition.</p>
        <p>And this quality is reflected in the words of the soldiers of Saul in Verse 249 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>“How many times has a small force vanquished a mighty army by the permission of Allah!” And Allah is ever with those who are STEADFAST.</b> It is likewise seen in Verse 142 of Surah aal-e-‘Imran, where Allah Ta’ala reminds those who presume themselves to be believers: <b>Do you think you will enter Paradise without Allah proving which of you truly strives and who possesses STEADFASTNESS?</b></p>
        <p>The fourth meaning is <b>PERSEVERANCE</b>. It means a sustained and dedicated effort to achieve or complete something—despite facing hardship, obstacles, or delays in attaining success.</p>
        <p>Surah al-‘Asr teaches us that, to attain success in this world and the Hereafter as a united ummah, perseverance must be practised collectively: <b>By time! Surely mankind is in loss—except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and urge ech other to the truth, and urge each other to PERSEVERANCE.</b> Meanwhile, Surah an-Nasr, besides serving as a source of inspiration for the perseverance of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in upholding Islam throughout his life—from the days of isolation to the moment when <b>people entering the religion of Allah in multitudes</b>—also reminds us that every success is, in reality, from Allah Jalla Jalaluhu.</p>
        <p>The fifth meaning is <b>CONSTANCY</b>—a consistent, stable, and unwavering commitment maintained over time, even in the absence of external pressure or compulsion. This quality is essential for ensuring the continuity of righteous deeds, and deeply necessary for preserving and nurturing one’s creed, spiritual purification, character, and acts of worship.</p>
        <p>One of the clearest illustrations of this quality is found in Allah’s command in Verse 132 of Surah Ta Ha: <b>And enjoin prayer upon your family (and people), and be CONSTANT in observing it.</b> The essence of this trait is also echoed in the words of the Messenger ﷺ, as recorded in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 6464: <b>“The most beloved of deeds to Allah are those done regularly and consistently, even if they are few.”</b></p>
        <p>The sixth meaning is <b>CONFINEMENT</b>, which means a pre-emptive act or proactive effort to keep oneself within the prescribed boundaries of divine law—physically or spiritually—by limiting one’s will, speech, movement, actions, or freedoms through restriction, habituation, or compulsion. It is employed to restrain desires and discipline the self from committing sin.</p>
        <p>One of the clearest examples of this quality is found in Verse 28 of Surah al-Kahf: <b>And CONFINE yourself with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. And do not let your eyes turn away from them, desiring the adornments of worldly life.</b> This Verse not only teaches us to confine ourselves from the love of worldly life, but also shows that the best way to do so is by remaining in the company of those who long for the Hereafter—even if they possess none of the worldly advantages.</p>
        <p>And the seventh meaning is <b>RESTRAINT</b>, which denotes the act or the effort of curbing powerful desires, overwhelming emotions, or impulsive behaviours before they erupt—so as to prevent falling into error, sin, or harm. This quality requires determination to remain within the boundaries set by the divine law, even when being pulled, tempted, pressured, or provoked.</p>
        <p>Allah (SWT) exemplifies this quality in Verses 23 to 29 of Surah Yusuf. In this story, Prophet Joseph (AS) repels the temptation of a woman—through knowledge, supplication, effort, and by His aid.</p>
        <p>The lesson of this quality is also seen in the story of the meeting between Prophet Moses and Prophet Khidr (AS) in Surah al-Kahf; where Prophet Moses acted hastily in making a judgement (in Verse 71), drew a conclusion before hearing an explanation (in Verse 74), and was intrigued and forgot his promise (in Verse 77). However, no one may regard Prophet Moses (AS) as lacking patience, because besides the encounter involving two vastly different kinds of knowledge, he was one of the Messengers of Ulul ‘Azmi.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, all seven meanings can interchange, overlap, or even converge—depending on the context of the Verse. Altogether, they fall within the broader framework of obeying Allah’s commands, avoiding His prohibitions, navigating difficult destinies, and facing the trials along the path of upholding Tawhid and reviving the Sunnah.</p>
<h3>Grasping Sabr</h3>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Abu Umayah ash-Sha’bani (RH) narrated that:</p>
<h4>أَتَيْتُ أَبَا ثَعْلَبَةَ الْخُشَنِيَّ فَقُلْتُ لَهُ كَيْفَ تَصْنَعُ فِي هَذِهِ الآيَةِ قَالَ أَيَّةُ آيَةٍ قُلْتُ قَوْلُهُ ‏:‏ ‏(‏ يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا عَلَيْكُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ لاَ يَضُرُّكُمْ مَنْ ضَلَّ إِذَا اهْتَدَيْتُمْ ‏)‏ قَالَ أَمَا وَاللَّهِ لَقَدْ سَأَلْتَ عَنْهَا خَبِيرًا سَأَلْتُ عَنْهَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَقَالَ ‏"‏ بَلِ ائْتَمِرُوا بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنَاهَوْا عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ حَتَّى إِذَا رَأَيْتَ شُحًّا مُطَاعًا وَهَوًى مُتَّبَعًا وَدُنْيَا مُؤْثَرَةً وَإِعْجَابَ كُلِّ ذِي رَأْىٍ بِرَأْيِهِ فَعَلَيْكَ بِخَاصَّةِ نَفْسِكَ وَدَعِ الْعَوَامَّ فَإِنَّ مِنْ وَرَائِكُمْ أَيَّامًا الصَّبْرُ فِيهِنَّ مِثْلُ الْقَبْضِ عَلَى الْجَمْرِ لِلْعَامِلِ فِيهِنَّ مِثْلُ أَجْرِ خَمْسِينَ رَجُلاً يَعْمَلُونَ مِثْلَ عَمَلِكُمْ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ بْنُ الْمُبَارَكِ وَزَادَنِي غَيْرُ عُتْبَةَ قِيلَ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ أَجْرُ خَمْسِينَ رَجُلاً مِنَّا أَوْ مِنْهُمْ قَالَ ‏"‏ لاَ بَلْ أَجْرُ خَمْسِينَ مِنْكُمْ ‏"‏ ‏.‏</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“I went to Abu Tha’labah al-Khushani (RA) and said to him, ‘How do you understand this Verse?’ He said, ‘Which Verse?’ I said, ‘His Saying:’”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b><i>“O you who have believed, take care of your own selves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided (5:105).”</i></b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“He said, ‘By Allah, you have indeed asked one who knows about it. I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about it, and he said:’”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Rather, enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, until such a time when you see avarice obeyed, desires followed, the world given preference, and every person of opinion admiring his own opinion.

<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“For ahead of you are days in which patience will be like grasping hot embers. The one who acts in those days will have the reward of fifty men who perform deeds like yours.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">‘Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak said:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Someone other than ‘Utbah added for me that it was said:”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“O Messenger of Allah, the reward of fifty men—of us or of them?”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">He said:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“No, rather the reward of fifty of you.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">✪ <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 3058 | Authentic: Darussalam ✪</p>
        <p>This hadith tells us that corruption will not merely afflict this ummah, but will come to dominate it. We will pass through a time in which patience is no longer something ordinarily borne, but a heat as intense as 900 °C, certain to inflict severe internal injury. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ marked that era with four moral diseases that gather and prevail simultaneously.</p>
        <p>First: <b>“Avarice obeyed”</b> refers to an avaricious economic system that is obeyed by this ummah—where money and profit are given priority, and most decisions are made based on how much wealth can be accumulated, even if it has negative consequences for society. This system opens the door to oppression through currency not backed by commodities, which can be used as a tool to manipulate the distribution of wealth, and through debt-based mechanisms that make people appear wealthy, while in reality they are ensnared and do not truly own anything.</p>
        <p>This ummah obeys that system because, at that time—as the Prophet ﷺ said in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 4297—their hearts had already become enervated due to love for this world and hatred for death. Not only is their wealth seized, like a feast to its platter, but their submission is also secured with ease.</p>
        <p>Second: <b>“Desires followed”</b> refers to a worldview in which personal desires are no longer restrained or disciplined, and are treated as the highest guiding principles in life. Verse 20 of Surah al-Hadid lists five types of worldly pleasures that tempt the soul:</p>
        <p>(i) <b>لَعِبٌ</b> | <b>Play</b>, when indulged in excessively, leads life down a path without direction. When it becomes a career, people no longer see it as a waste of time.</p>
        <p>(ii) <b>لَهْوٌ</b> | <b>Amusement and distraction</b> (such as music) diverts the heart from what is truly important, especially remembrance of Allah. Its impact is magnified when it becomes an industry.</p>
        <p>(iii) <b>زِينَةٌ</b> | <b>Worldly adornment</b> causes the self to become captivated by appearance and allure. If left unchecked, it can give rise to various maladies of the soul, such as attention-seeking, vanity, and immoral behaviour.</p>
        <p>(iv) <b>تَفَاخُرٌ بَيْنَكُمْ</b> | <b>Mutual boasting</b> leads to a superficial sense of self-worth, through social comparison based on pride. When it becomes a culture, it breeds hearts filled with envy and malice.</p>
        <p>(v) <b>تَكَاثُرٌ فِي الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَوْلَادِ</b> | <b>Rivalry in wealth and children</b> produces slaves of money and lovers of status. When it is regarded as progress, it will be pursued relentlessly, even at the expense of one’s faith.</p>
        <p>All of this is no more than the delusion of enjoyment that distances a person from the forgiveness and pleasure of Allah. That is the love of the world.</p>
        <p>Third: <b>“the world given preference”</b> refers to a political system that elevates worldly concerns over the Hereafter. Policies are assessed by material output, not by moral consideration or truth derived from God. Development is centred on GDP, infrastructure, and the projection of power—rather than Islam, iman, and ihsan. Within this framework, religion is no longer a reference point in shaping the direction of public life. The world is no longer treated as a mere stopping place, but as the final destination of an aspiration.</p>
        <p>In that time, the words of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2669 come to pass. From economic and social life to politics, this ummah will follow the People of the Book step by step—even into the hole of a lizard. Not all of them, but the majority among them.</p>
        <p>Fourth: <b>“every person of opinion admiring his own opinion”</b> refers to the methodology by which Islam is understood and practised. If the three preceding moral diseases describe the people of worldly attachment, this final one speaks of the people of religion. “Every person of opinion” refers to religious figures who wield influence, whether through authority or reputation. And “admiring his own opinion” reflects pride and a refusal to submit to divine revelation.</p>
        <p>This methodological disease elevates human reasoning as a source of authority above the Word of Allah (SWT) and the sayings of His Messenger. Society’s understanding is shaped by personal opinions, inherited thought, or the teachings introduced by the founders of the seventy-two deviant sects, even extending to the madness of Greek philosophical reasoning. The culture of verifying revelation is replaced by a culture of blindly trusting the words of religious authorities. Once such views become established custom and are regarded as genuine teachings—as ‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud (RA) remarked in <i>Sunan ad-Darimi</i> 187—any attempt at correction is met with rejection and resistance.</p>
        <p>What The Chosen One ﷺ outlined is the essence of the warning. What if we say that the modern terms capturing this essence are: (1) <b>capitalist economic system</b>, (2) <b>liberal worldview</b>, (3) <b>secular political system</b>, and (4) <b>methodology of the people of innovation</b>? Now, are you aware of the era in which all of this comes to pass?</p>
        <p>This is an era in which calling people back to the true Islamic way of life—one that conforms to the Sunnah of Rasulullah ﷺ and his Companions (RA), and adheres to the manhaj of the Salaf us-Soleh—is like bearing the scorching pain of burning embers. You will be regarded as strange, suspected of deviation, seen as extreme or outdated, and labelled with various accusations. Do not grieve over that pain, for it is immensely worthwhile—for its reward is like the deeds of fifty Companions.</p>
        <p>Leave the ways of life and prevailing norms of the masses, yet continue to uphold enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, to the best of your ability. Practise the true teachings of Ahlu Sunnah wal-Jama’ah beginning with yourself, your family, and those within your own circle who share the same path. For not everyone is a scholar. You and I are ordinary people, who require space and time to learn, understand, deepen, reflect upon, practise, preserve, and refine both knowledge and deeds.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the very act of patience itself requires resolve, effort, and training to be exercised at the very first strike. And patience draws forth even greater rewards, as mentioned in the Verses of the Quran—such as honour, forgiveness, divine assistance, and the love of God. Allah says in Surah as-Sajdah, Verse 24:</p>
