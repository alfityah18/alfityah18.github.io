        <p>We often hear the phrase, “Patience is a part of faith.” This originates from the words of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud (RA) as recorded in <i>Shu’ab al-Iman</i> 9083, and authenticated by Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalani (RH). However, the phrase “a part” can be misleading, as in English, it may imply an undefined portion rather than an equal division. The more accurate translation is “half.” The full hadith is as follows:</p>
<h4>الصَّبْرُ نِصْفُ الإِيمَانِ وَالْيَقِينُ الإِيمَانُ كُلُّهُ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“PATIENCE is half of faith, and CERTAINTY is faith in its entirety.”</b></p>
        <p>And this statement originates from the Verses of the Quran, where patience is paired with the other half of faith—gratitude. For instance, in Verse 31 of Surah Luqman, Allah (SWT) says:</p>
<h4>أَلَمۡ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱلۡفُلۡكَ تَجۡرِي فِي ٱلۡبَحۡرِ بِنِعۡمَتِ ٱللَّهِ لِيُرِيَكُم مِّنۡ ءَايَٰتِهِۦٓۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَأٓيَٰتࣲ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارࣲ شَكُورࣲ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Do you not see that the ships sail upon the sea by the grace of Allah, so that He may show you some of His signs? Indeed, in this are signs for those who are PATIENT and GRATEFUL.</b></p>
        <p>Then, there is also a hadith of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 35, which states that faith consists of more than seventy branches. How do we understand this? To make it clearer, let us use an analogy.</p>
        <p>Imagine faith as a planet within our hearts. At its very core lies certainty—without absolute certainty, the planet of faith cannot exist. Surrounding this core is the mantle, representing patience and gratitude, which form the foundation that upholds faith. Finally, on the crust or surface, the seventy-plus branches of faith are spread out, manifesting in various aspects of belief and practice.</p>
        <p>From this, we begin to understand the immense importance of patience in living a life of faith. Without patience, the perfection of faith cannot be attained. In fact, patience is a virtue placed at an exceptionally high rank, as Allah (AWJ) declares in Verse 10 of Surah Az-Zumar:</p>
<h4>إِنَّمَا يُوَفَّى ٱلصَّٰبِرُونَ أَجۡرَهُم بِغَيۡرِ حِسَابࣲ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Only those who are patient will be given their reward without limit.</b></p>
        <p>Not only that, but without patience, the core of certainty will begin to crack, the mantle of gratitude will weaken, and the branches of faith on the surface will erode. Without patience, the planet of faith will shatter. This aligns with the words of ‘Ali (RA) in <i>As-Sabr</i> by Ibn Abi Dunya 8:</p>
<h4>أَلَا إِنَّ الصَّبْرَ مِنَ الْإِيمَانِ بِمَنْزِلَةِ الرَّأْسِ مِنَ الْجَسَدِ فَإِذَا قُطِعَ الرَّأْسُ بَادَ الْجَسَدُ أَلَا إِنَّهُ لَا إِيمَانَ لِمَنْ لَا صَبْرَ لَهُ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Surely, patience in relation to faith is like the head to the body—if the head is severed, the body perishes. Indeed, there is no faith for the one who has no patience.”</b></p>
