        <p>In recent times, the entire nation has been shaken by a series of crimes involving children and underage teenagers. What is worrying is that cases of bullying, abuse, and even murder are now occurring in educational institutions that are supposed to be safe spaces for our children. Abroad, particularly in the United States, mass shootings among teenagers have already become commonplace news. Such reports were unheard of among previous generations.</p>
<h3>Times Are Worsening</h3>
        <p>Based on global homicide data reported by Index Mundi and UNODC, the worldwide murder rate between 1995 and 2023 appears to have increased by approximately 84%. This statistic shows an excessively high increase over just a single generation, and does not include killings in armed conflicts. This issue was mentioned by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7064, that when the Hour draws near, many killings will take place.</p>
        <p>A sudden rise in crime rates is a wake-up call for us to reflect upon the words of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, heard by Anas ibn Malik (RA) in the hadith under discussion—that times are worsening. From politics and the economy to society, we cannot deny that life in our own childhood was more peaceful. Our parents, in turn, would feel that their time was better, and so it continues.</p>
        <p>This is our time. Cases of corruption among politicians have never diminished, and incompetency has become a chronic disease of the world’s leaders. Fiat currency, lacking intrinsic value, is steadily losing its worth, and almost everyone is trapped in debt by the global economic system based on riba. The culture of knowledge among society is gradually dying, replaced by boundless socialising, while social media gives rise to more mediocre individuals who pretend to be wise in discussing weighty matters. And all of these are beads of the minor signs of the Hour that are now falling into place.</p>
        <p>Have you ever reflected on why times are worsening?</p>
<h3>Root Causes</h3>
        <p>In <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 1385, Abu Hurayrah (RA) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>
<h4>كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى الْفِطْرَةِ، فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ</h4>
