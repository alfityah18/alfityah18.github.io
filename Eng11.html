        <p>In recent times, the entire nation has been shaken by a series of crimes involving children and underage teenagers. What is worrying is that cases of bullying, abuse, and even murder are now occurring in educational institutions that are supposed to be safe spaces for our children. Abroad, particularly in the United States, mass shootings among teenagers have already become commonplace news. Such reports were unheard of among previous generations.</p>
<h3>Times Are Worsening</h3>
        <p>Based on global homicide data reported by Index Mundi and UNODC, the worldwide murder rate between 1995 and 2023 appears to have increased by approximately 84%. This statistic shows an excessively high increase over just a single generation, and does not include killings in armed conflicts. This issue was mentioned by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7064, that when the Hour draws near, many killings will take place.</p>
        <p>A sudden rise in crime rates is a wake-up call for us to reflect upon the words of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, heard by Anas ibn Malik (RA) in the hadith under discussion—that times are worsening. From politics and the economy to society, we cannot deny that life in our own childhood was more peaceful. Our parents, in turn, would feel that their time was better, and so it continues.</p>        
        <p>Have you ever reflected on why times are worsening?</p>
<h3>Root Causes</h3>
<h4>ظَهَرَ ٱلۡفَسَادُ فِي ٱلۡبَرِّ وَٱلۡبَحۡرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتۡ أَيۡدِي ٱلنَّاسِ لِيُذِيقَهُم بَعۡضَ ٱلَّذِي عَمِلُواْ لَعَلَّهُمۡ يَرۡجِعُونَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea as a result of what people’s hands have done, so that Allah may let them taste the consequences of some of their deeds—perhaps they might return (to the right path).</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Ar-Rum 30: Ayat 41</p>
        <p>All calamities that occur—whether floods on land or storms at sea—are the consequences of human sins. Likewise, the rise in crime rates, whether juvenile or otherwise, and the anxiety we experience as a result, as well as political dysfunction, economic oppression, and social collapse, are all the result of the sins of this ummah collectively. For those who are guilty, it is a punishment; and for those who are innocent, it is a trial. Through the narration of Abu Musa (RA), in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 4278, the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>
<h4>أُمَّتِي هَذِهِ أُمَّةٌ مَرْحُومَةٌ لَيْسَ عَلَيْهَا عَذَابٌ فِي الآخِرَةِ عَذَابُهَا فِي الدُّنْيَا الْفِتَنُ وَالزَّلاَزِلُ وَالْقَتْلُ</h4>        
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>This ummah of mine is one to which mercy is shown. There will be no punishment for it in the Hereafter, but its punishment is in this world—through trials, upheavals, and widespread killing.</b></p> 
        <p>Times that are worsening are a sign of the increasing prevalence of sin. The primary cause lies in sin against ad-deen—that is, the comprehensive way of life or system of living practiced by today’s ummah.</p>
        <p>To our left, we see those who are enamoured with the life of the world. The widespread corruption we witness today is evidence of the failure of Western systems, which have been borrowed by most Muslim countries. Indeed, many Muslim nations have declared their constitutions secular.</p>
        <p>Political systems based on secularism, which separate governance from religious guidance—result only in division, ineffective legislation, and rising crime rates. Capitalist economic systems, which prioritise profit over social welfare—in turn bring currency instability, normalise indebtedness, and increase the burdens of living. Meanwhile, social life guided by liberalism, which allows excessive personal freedom—leads only to moral decay, frivolous pursuits, and a preoccupation with worldly pleasures.</p>
        <p>On the right, meanwhile, we see religious groups who have strayed from the straight path. They persist in errors inherited across generations. One nation has openly declared its state creed to be that of the people of innovation, while some claim to follow one of the four imams of the legal schools, yet, ironically, practise innovation in both creed and worship.</p>
        <p>They subtly promote major shirk through deceptive means, such as conflating the concepts of supplication and tawassul. They are also entirely unwilling to speak about innovation, as though there were no warning or danger associated with it. Instead, they delight in spreading superstitious tales, conspiracy theories, and philosophies detached from the realities set out in the Quran and Hadith. Know that major shirk nullifies one’s Islam. Innovation, on the other hand, erases rewards and increases sin. As for superstition, it merely stifles reason and prevents the ummah from progressing in this rapidly advancing age of science and technology.</p>
        <p>Now, do you understand why reports of crimes among children and teenagers are increasing? It is not because corporal punishment has been banned in schools, but due to something far greater than that: sin.</p>
<h3>The Path to Restoration</h3>
        <p>We know that at every stage, the ummah is obliged to restore the Islamic way of life. Yet in our time, where is the true example of Islam? Many factions are in dispute, each claiming to represent Ahlu Sunnah. Which one, then, is correct? For those who have not studied or whose religious knowledge is shallow, how can they tell truth from falsehood, when all appear to recite the Quran and quote the Hadith? Where, or with whom, should they begin?</p>
