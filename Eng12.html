<h3>Hadith Explanation</h3>
        
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘No, O Lord.’</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Allah will say:</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘However, you have one good deed with Us, and you will not be wronged today.’</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Then a card will be brought forth; on it is written: ‘I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.’ He will say:</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘Bring forth your scales.’</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>He will ask:</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘O Lord, what is this card compared to these scrolls?’</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Allah will say:</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘You will not be wronged.’</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>The scrolls will then be placed on one side of the scale, and the card on the other; the scrolls will become light, and the card will be heavy—for nothing outweighs the Name of Allah.”</b></p>
        <p>It should be known the declaration was truly understood and lived out in his life—not merely uttered as words. The ninety-nine scrolls, on the other hand, represent sins that do not include the nullifiers of the shahadah which remove a person from the fold of Islam. Sadly, there are some among the ummah today who remain unaware or indifferent to the existence of such sins.</p>
