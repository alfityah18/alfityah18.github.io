      <p>The call of the preachers referred to by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in this hadith is not a call to minor sins. Nor is it an innovation in acts of worship; rather, they are dangers that can undermine one’s creed. This is made clear through the narration of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman (RA) recorded in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7084, in which he said:</p>
<h4>كَانَ النَّاسُ يَسْأَلُونَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم عَنِ الْخَيْرِ، وَكُنْتُ أَسْأَلُهُ عَنِ الشَّرِّ، مَخَافَةَ أَنْ يُدْرِكَنِي فَقُلْتُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ إِنَّا كُنَّا فِي جَاهِلِيَّةٍ وَشَرٍّ فَجَاءَنَا اللَّهُ بِهَذَا الْخَيْرِ، فَهَلْ بَعْدَ هَذَا الْخَيْرِ مِنْ شَرٍّ قَالَ ‏"‏نَعَمْ‏"‏‏.‏ قُلْتُ وَهَلْ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ الشَّرِّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ قَالَ ‏"‏نَعَمْ، وَفِيهِ دَخَنٌ‏"‏‏.‏ قُلْتُ وَمَا دَخَنُهُ قَالَ ‏"‏قَوْمٌ يَهْدُونَ بِغَيْرِ هَدْىٍ، تَعْرِفُ مِنْهُمْ وَتُنْكِرُ‏"‏‏.‏ قُلْتُ فَهَلْ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ الْخَيْرِ مِنْ شَرٍّ قَالَ ‏"‏نَعَمْ، دُعَاةٌ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ جَهَنَّمَ، مَنْ أَجَابَهُمْ إِلَيْهَا قَذَفُوهُ فِيهَا‏"‏‏.‏ قُلْتُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صِفْهُمْ لَنَا‏.‏ قَالَ ‏"‏هُمْ مِنْ جِلْدَتِنَا، وَيَتَكَلَّمُونَ بِأَلْسِنَتِنَا"‏‏.‏ قُلْتُ فَمَا تَأْمُرُنِي إِنْ أَدْرَكَنِي ذَلِكَ قَالَ ‏"‏تَلْزَمُ جَمَاعَةَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ وَإِمَامَهُمْ‏"‏‏.‏ قُلْتُ فَإِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُمْ جَمَاعَةٌ وَلاَ إِمَامٌ قَالَ ‏"‏فَاعْتَزِلْ تِلْكَ الْفِرَقَ كُلَّهَا، وَلَوْ أَنْ تَعَضَّ بِأَصْلِ شَجَرَةٍ، حَتَّى يُدْرِكَكَ الْمَوْتُ، وَأَنْتَ عَلَى ذَلِكَ‏"‏‏.‏</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph">People used to ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about good, but I used to ask him about evil, fearing that it might reach me. So I said:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“O Messenger of Allah, we were in ignorance and evil, and Allah brought us this good. Will there be any evil after this good?”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph">He said: <b>“Yes.”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“And will there be any good after that evil?”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Yes, but it will be tainted.”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“And what is its taint?”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“A people who guide by other than my guidance; you will recognise some things from them and reject others.”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Then will there be any evil after that good?”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Yes—callers at the gates of Hell; whoever responds to them, they will throw him into it.”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“O Messenger of Allah, describe them to us.”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“They are from our own people, and they speak with our tongues.”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“What do you command me to do if I reach that time?”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Adhere to the community of the Muslims and their leader.”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“And if they have no community and no leader?”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Then keep away from all those groups, even if you must cling to the root of a tree until death reaches you while you are in that state.”</b></p>
      <p><i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7084 does not present a fixed historical timeline, but rather a recurring pattern that continues to emerge throughout the ages. Ignorance and evil refer to the period of Jahiliyyah before the advent of the Prophet ﷺ. While the good signifies Islam, which united the ummah upon the true guidance brought by him.</p>
      <p>Thereafter, evil re-emerged—beginning during the time of the Companions—in the form of political turmoil, internal division, and the rise of deviant factions. This was followed by a phase in which good still remained, yet became intermixed with elements of deviation, misleading leadership, and guidance that was not fully aligned with the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and the Sunnah of the Companions (RA).</p>
      <p>Thereafter, from this emerge the preachers who call to various forms of destruction—endangering the creed and potentially causing a person to be cast into the Fire, whether for a very long time, or even eternally. They come from within this very religion and speak with the language of the faithful. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded us not to accept any of their teachings, even if one must remain alone until the end of life. All the more so in this borderless digital world, where anyone can appear on our screens bringing danger.</p>
      <p>And the gravest danger is the sins that nullify Islam. There are many matters that can cause a person to fall into apostasy; however, we will confine ourselves to discussing the <b>ten nullifiers of Islam</b> that are most perilous, for many Muslims remain unaware of them and do not fully comprehend their reality. Learn them well, so that you are not deceived and may distance yourself from those who promote them.</p>
         
<h3>1. Shirk</h3>
<h4>إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغۡفِرُ أَن يُشۡرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغۡفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُۚ وَمَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفۡتَرَىٰٓ إِثۡمًا عَظِيمًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating others with Him, but forgives anything else of whoever He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah has indeed committed a tremendous sin.</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Surah an-Nisa 4 : Verse 48</p>
<h4>وَمَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدۡ ضَلَّ ضَلَٰلَۢا بَعِيدًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>And whoever associates others with Allah has clearly gone far astray.</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Surah an-Nisa 4 : Verse 116</p>
<h4>إِنَّهُۥ مَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدۡ حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيۡهِ ٱلۡجَنَّةَ وَمَأۡوَىٰهُ ٱلنَّارُۖ وَمَا لِلظَّٰلِمِينَ مِنۡ أَنصَارࣲ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Whoever associates others with Allah will surely be forbidden Paradise by Allah. Their eternal home will be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers.</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Surah al-Maidah 5 : Verse 72</p>
      <p>The first nullifier of Islam is shirk; that is, to ascribe partners to Allah (SWT). A common misunderstanding among Muslims is the assumption that shirk refers only to the worship of idols or temple deities. In reality, shirk can manifest in various forms. Broadly speaking, shirk is divided into two types: major shirk (shirk akbar) and minor shirk (shirk asghar). Some scholars add a third type, namely hidden shirk (shirk khafi), though it is in fact included within the second type.</p>
      <p>Based on the statement of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recorded in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 86, shirk is the gravest of sins. Through his statement in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 4974, we come to understand why—because it is a sin that affronts the majesty of Allah Ta’ala. Meanwhile, his statement in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 3334 reminds us of what we have long forgotten: that even when we were still within the loins of Prophet Adam (AS), a covenant was already taken from us by Allah (AWJ) that we should not associate anything with Him.</p>
      <p>Know that major shirk expels a person from the fold of Islam; it is not forgiven by Allah if one dies upon it, and its perpetrator will be punished in the Fire eternally. Minor shirk, however, does not invalidate one’s Islam, though its sin remains grave and it nullifies the reward of one’s deeds. In this discussion, we shall confine ourselves to several forms of major shirk that commonly occur in societies around the world, as well as within this Ummah itself—all of which nullify Islam.</p>
