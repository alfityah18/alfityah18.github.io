        <p>This hadith conveys a deeply troubling era, where many among this ummah will face what is considered the gravest of fitnas, as stated by Hudhayfah al-Yaman (RA) in <i>Musnad Ibn Abi Shaybah</i> 37569 – the inability to distinguish between good and bad. Otherwise, they would never resort to ignorant figures as their sources of guidance. Indeed, this khabar deserves serious attention, for it shall not occur after the times of Imam Mahdi and Prophet Jesus (AS), as elucidated in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2937, that every Muslim shall depart from this mortal realm before the Hour. It may have already transpired, or is presently unfolding, unbeknownst to the masses. <b>الله أعلم</b>.</p>
<h4>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ انْتِزَاعًا يَنْتَزِعُهُ مِنَ الْعِبَادِ وَلَكِنْ يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ بِقَبْضِ الْعُلَمَاءِ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Indeed, Allah does not take away knowledge abruptly, snatching it away from His servants. Rather, He takes away knowledge through the grasp of scholars.”</b></p>
<h3>The Grasp of Scholars</h3>
         <p>Even at the time of its occurrence, people tend to perceive it as a tale from a distant period, yet to come. This misunderstanding stems from the misinterpretation of the statement <b>“when no knowledgeable individual remains,”</b> leading to the mistaken belief that it implies the demise of all scholars on Earth. Is this truly the case? According to Ar-Raghib al-Isfahani (RH) in his work <i>Al-Mufradat fi Gharib il-Quran</i>, <b>القَبْضُ</b> sometimes carries a metaphorical connotation associated with <b>“death,”</b> as exemplified in the phrase <b>قَبَضَهُ اللّٰهُ</b>, which means <b>“being taken by Allah’s grasp.”</b> However, it is important to note that death is not necessarily the only interpretation for the meaning of <b>القَبْضُ</b> or <b>“the grasp”</b> in this hadith.</p>
         <p>It can also carry the meaning of <b>“withhold,”</b> as shown in the Quran, such as in Verse 245 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>وَٱللَّهُ يَقْبِضُ وَيَبْصُۜطُ</b>, which means <b>“and it is Allah who withholds or grants abundance.”</b> By not limiting the interpretation of “the grasp” solely to death, we can explore the depth of this hadith from a more expansive standpoint. Therefore, we can discern that the saying of Nabi ﷺ <b>“when no knowledgeable individual remains”</b> can also mean that the scholars, in reality, persist but are deliberately “withheld” or “kept away from the public.” This notion is supported by his statement in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 2484, which indicates the presence of scholars in every generation until the time of Antichrist.</p>
         <p>With the support of other relevant hadiths, we are now able to grasp this heart-rending tale with profound insight and comprehension. It is a tale of a community enamored by worldly affairs rather than the hereafter <span class="small-word">[i]</span>. This led Allah (SWT) to reclaim the knowledge bestowed upon them. Gradually, stage by stage, generation after generation. Through the demise of illustrious scholars <span class="small-word">[ii]</span>, and those who have emerged later have become strangers <span class="small-word">[iii]</span>, even rejected by the majority of that community <span class="small-word">[iv]</span>. For souls distant from the authentic teachings of Rasulullah ﷺ, cannot discern the true scholars from the false <span class="small-word">[v]</span>.</p>

<h3>The Knowledge</h3>
         <p>Another reason why society remains inattentive during that challenging period is because new branches of knowledge keep emerging and growing right before their eyes, making it difficult to fully comprehend the situation. This has been mentioned by Rasulullah ﷺ in <i>Sunan an-Nasa’i</i> 4456: <b>وَيَظْهَرَ الْعِلْمُ</b>, <b>“and the emergence of knowledge.”</b> Does the saying contradict the hadith discussed here? No, because upon careful examination, we will find that both are addressing two different types of knowledge. As mentioned in the previous article, <i>The Challenge of Science and Technology</i>, and based on evidence such as Verse 7 of Surah ar-Rum and <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2722 – knowledge is divided into <b>two types</b>.</p>
         <p>The first is <b>beneficial knowledge</b>. It is the divine knowledge, commonly known as religious knowledge, namely the Quran and Sunnah, the words of Allah and the words of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. And other knowledge that possesses or establishes a connection with divine knowledge. It brings both, worldly benefits and, most importantly, benefits in the hereafter. This is the type of <b>knowledge that is taken away</b>. The second is <b>futile knowledge</b>. It does not establish any connection with divine knowledge, and only generates worldly benefits, disregarding the benefits in the hereafter. This is the <b>knowledge that widely spreads in the end times</b>. It is crucial to remember that the same knowledge can be either beneficial or futile. For instance, if cosmology becomes a means for one to draw closer to Allah (AWJ), it becomes beneficial. Conversely, it can be otherwise.</p>
<h4>يَعْلَمُونَ ظَٰهِرًا مِّنَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمْ غَٰفِلُونَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>They only know but a surface understanding of worldly affairs of this life, yet towards the realm of the hereafter, they remain heedless.</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Ar-Rum 30: Verse 7</p>
<h3>The True Scholars</h3>
         <p>What is signified by “the inability to distinguish between good and bad” within the context of this hadith is the failure of the general public to recognize, evaluate, and ascertain the true ulama. To gauge whether this fitna prevails in our era or not, we can scrutinize the public's perception of the ulama and determine whether it aligns with the definition derived from the Quran, Hadith, and Classical Arabic. In short, let us begin with the words of the most qualified in defining who the true scholars are, words that contain nothing but the truth, the Creator of scholars Himself; our Lord in Verse 28 of Surah Fatir:</p>
<h4>إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى ٱللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ٱلْعُلَمَٰٓؤُا۟</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Indeed, of all of His servants, those who truly FEAR Allah are only the ulama.</b></p>
         <p>The term <b>الْخَشْيَةُ</b> or “fear” in this Verse means <b>“a feeling of reverence accompanied by a sense of fear.”</b> This feeling only emerges after understanding the true essence of what is feared and revered. Regarding this Verse, Ibn Kathir (RH) elaborated that the more they know about the Almighty, All-Powerful, All-Knowing, who possesses the most perfect Attributes and the most beautiful Names; the more they will fear Him. Thus, true scholars are those who not only possess knowledge but, through knowledge, they can comprehend and feel the greatness of Allah to the extent that the feeling of <b>خَشْيَةُ</b> is formed within their hearts. This emotional connection is the core that shapes pure feelings and a sound mind, reflecting through their words, influencing their actions.</p>
         <p>In <i>Rawdatul 'Uqala</i> 9, Ibn Mas'ud (RA) uttered: <b>“Knowledge is not the abundance of narration, but knowledge is the abundance of الْخَشْيَةُ.”</b> Scholars are not merely those who memorize and convey knowledge, but those who comprehend and apply it – just as Abu Darda (RA) explained in <i>Sunan ad-Darimi</i> 295, that one is not considered a scholar, until they seek knowledge, and put it into practice. These evidences clearly indicate that practice begins within the heart. In the end of times, this essential truth often goes unnoticed. In <i>Sunan ad-Darimi</i> 384, ‘Ali (RA) foretold that there will be people who carry knowledge, but their knowledge does not go beyond their throats. Their actions will contradict their knowledge, their private lives will conflict with their public image, and their intention is not sincere but rather to boast and to consider themselves superior to others.</p>
         <p>The crucial question arises: in what kind of era do such individuals become numerous? It is an era when society assesses scholars based on <b>superficial criteria</b>: <b>certificates</b>, <b>titles</b>, <b>positions</b>, <b>influence</b>, <b>popularity</b> and <b>eloquence of speech</b>. True scholars perceive their position as a trust from Allah and a servant's responsibility, not as a means for self-aggrandisement. True scholars are the guiding stars for the journey of the ummah, not those who exploit others to elevate themselves to stardom. True scholars uphold justice towards the Quran and the Sunnah, not manipulating them for worldly purposes.</p>

<h4>حَتَّى إِذَا لَمْ يُبْقِ عَالِمًا اتَّخَذَ النَّاسُ رُءُوسًا جُهَّالاً فَسُئِلُوا فَأَفْتَوْا بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ فَضَلُّوا وَأَضَلُّوا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Until such time when no knowledgeable individual remains, people will turn to ignorant figureheads and seek their counsel. They will issue religious verdicts without knowledge, leading astray themselves and others.”</b></p>
<h3>The Ignorant Figureheads</h3>
         <p>Taking into account the usage of <b>الْجَاهِلُ</b> during the time of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and its portrayal in the Quran, the ignorant figure can be categorized into two primary types. The first comprises individuals who do not know their own circumstances, as exemplified in its usage in Verse 273 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>“Those who <i>do not know</i> with their situation will think they are not in need of charity because they do not beg.”</b> These individuals are not inherently malevolent but suffer from a lack of knowledge and information. On the flip side, the second type encompasses those considered foolish and abhorrent, as illustrated in its usage in Verse 67 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>“They said, ‘Do you take us in ridicule?’ Moses said, ‘I seek refuge in Allah from being among the <i>ignorant</i>.’”</b> These are individuals who exhibit undesirable qualities, as mentioned in the preceding narration by ‘Ali (RA).</p>
         <p>From the interpretation of <b>الْجَهْلُ</b> or “ignorance,” the ignorant figurehead can further be categorized into three secondary types. The first type comprises <b>a heart devoid of knowledge</b>, encompassing both the righteous lacking sufficient knowledge, and the wicked speaking without knowledge. This type is of a general nature. The second type are <b>those whose beliefs contradict reality</b>. This is related to the matters of aqidah, and the ignorant figures in this category are the Ahlul Bid’ah, mentioned by Rasul ﷺ in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 4597 as the seventy-two deviant sects. The third type encompasses <b>individuals whose actions are not in accordance with what is considered appropriate</b>. This includes Ahlul Bid'ah in matters of ibadah; Ahlu Sunnah who practice bid’ah in ibadah; and Ahlu Sunnah who are free from innovations but violate the boundaries of shariah, which means not practicing the knowledge they teach to others. <b>“Verily, the most fearful thing I fear for my ummah is every hypocrite with a knowledgeable tongue.”</b> Elaborating on the words of Nabi ﷺ in <i>Musnad Ahmad</i> 1/86, in another narration, 'Umar (RA) uttered: <b>“Their tongues are knowledgeable, yet their hearts and actions are ignorant.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
         <p>Through research encompassing the Quran, Hadith, and Classical Arabic, we now acquire a broader perspective on the discussed hadith. It not only helps us recognize the true scholars and ignorant figures but also brings awareness that the era described by Rasulullah ﷺ is more perilous than previously imagined, and it might already be unfolding. In addition to comprehending our era, the essence lies not in accusing others, but instead, in focusing on self-improvement as the paramount aspect. Moreover, in fostering the emergence of genuine scholars. And there is no other way to avoid the fitna mentioned by Hudhayfah (RA) except by seeking beneficial knowledge, and put it into practice. Consider the wisdom conveyed by Luqman (AS) found in <i>Al-Muwatta’</i> 1890:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Knowledge is that which enlivens the heart, much like how rain rejuvenates the arid land.”</b></p>
