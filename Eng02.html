        <p>This hadith conveys a deeply troubling era, where many among this ummah will face what is considered the gravest of fitnas, as stated by Hudhayfah al-Yaman (RA) in <b>Musnad Ibn Abi Shaybah</b> 37569 – the inability to distinguish between good and bad. Otherwise, they would never resort to ignorant figures as their sources of guidance. Indeed, this khabar deserves serious attention, for it shall not occur after the times of Imam Mahdi and Prophet Jesus (AS), as elucidated in <b>Sahih Muslim</b> 2937, that every Muslim shall depart from this mortal realm before the Hour. It may have already transpired, or is presently unfolding, unbeknownst to the masses. <b>الله أعلم</b>.</p>
         <p class="small-text">*The full hadith is longer; refer to <i>Sahih Muslim</i>.</p>
<h4>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ انْتِزَاعًا يَنْتَزِعُهُ مِنَ الْعِبَادِ وَلَكِنْ يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ بِقَبْضِ الْعُلَمَاءِ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Indeed, Allah does not take away knowledge abruptly, snatching it away from His servants. Rather, He takes away knowledge through 
the grasp of scholars.”
</b></p>
<h3>The Grasp of Scholars</h3>
