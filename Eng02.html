        <p>This narration* holds remarkable significance. It tells the story of Angel Gabriel (AS) who visited Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to teach us the most essential aspects of living a religious life, such as how to become a <b>Muslim</b>, a <b>Mu’min</b>, or attain the highest status of a <b>Muhsin</b>. All of which can’t be complete without taking into account the importance of <b>knowledge of fitan</b>. And Allah (SWT) placed two incredibly significant signs of the Hour in our time, in this highly critical hadith. Does it indicate that the end of times is proximate? Most certainly. Does it indicate that the phase of minor signs is approaching its end? <b>الله أعلم</b>.</p>
         <p class="small-text">*The full hadith is longer; refer to <i>Sahih Muslim</i>.</p>
<h3>The Signs Have Been Realized</h3>
<h4>لاَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى تُكَلِّمَ السِّبَاعُ الإِنْسَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Before the Hour strikes, a time will come when the ‘predatory beings' will converse with mankind.”</b></p>
         <p>Many have fallen victim to its powerful grasp – spending excessive amounts of time under its captivity;  familial ties wane as virtual relationships gain traction; social skills wither, and health issues abound, especially among children; opportunities to indulge in sinful acts are at one's fingertips; even new predators like ChatGPT have claimed some job opportunities. But Islam is not a stagnant way of life in the passage of time. The predator is like a mighty lion, with <b>strength</b> and <b>wisdom</b>, it can be conquered, tamed, and its benefits reaped.</p>
