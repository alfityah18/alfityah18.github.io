        <p>This hadith conveys a deeply troubling era, where many among this ummah will face what is considered the gravest of fitnas, as stated by Hudhayfah al-Yaman (RA) in <i>Musnad Ibn Abi Shaybah</i> 37569 – the inability to distinguish between good and bad. Otherwise, they would never resort to ignorant figures as their sources of guidance. Indeed, this khabar deserves serious attention, for it shall not occur after the times of Imam Mahdi and Prophet Jesus (AS), as elucidated in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2937, that every Muslim shall depart from this mortal realm before the Hour. It may have already transpired, or is presently unfolding, unbeknownst to the masses. <b>الله أعلم</b>.</p>
<h4>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ انْتِزَاعًا يَنْتَزِعُهُ مِنَ الْعِبَادِ وَلَكِنْ يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ بِقَبْضِ الْعُلَمَاءِ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Indeed, Allah does not take away knowledge abruptly, snatching it away from His servants. Rather, He takes away knowledge through the grasp of scholars.”</b></p>
<h3>The Grasp of Scholars</h3>
         <p>Even at the time of its occurrence, people tend to perceive it as a tale from a distant period, yet to come. This misunderstanding stems from the misinterpretation of the statement <b>“when no knowledgeable individual remains,”</b> leading to the mistaken belief that it implies the demise of all scholars on Earth. Is this truly the case? According to Ar-Raghib al-Isfahani (RH) in his work <i>Al-Mufradat fi Gharib il-Quran</i>, <b>القَبْضُ</b> sometimes carries a metaphorical connotation associated with <b>“death,”</b> as exemplified in the phrase <b>قَبَضَهُ اللّٰهُ</b>, which means <b>“being taken by Allah’s grasp.”</b> However, it is important to note that death is not necessarily the only interpretation for the meaning of <b>القَبْضُ</b> or <b>“the grasp”</b> in this hadith.</p>
         <p>It can also carry the meaning of <b>“withhold,”</b> as shown in the Quran, such as in Verse 245 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>وَٱللَّهُ يَقْبِضُ وَيَبْصُۜطُ</b>, which means <b>“and it is Allah who withholds or grants abundance.”</b> By not limiting the interpretation of “the grasp” solely to death, we can explore the depth of this hadith from a more expansive standpoint. Therefore, we can discern that the saying of Nabi ﷺ <b>“when no knowledgeable individual remains”</b> can also mean that the scholars, in reality, persist but are deliberately “withheld” or “kept away from the public.” This notion is supported by his statement in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 2484, which indicates the presence of scholars in every generation until the time of Antichrist.</p>
         <p>With the support of other relevant hadiths, we are now able to grasp this heart-rending tale with profound insight and comprehension. It is a tale of a community enamored by worldly affairs rather than the hereafter <span class="small-word">[i]</span>. This led Allah (SWT) to reclaim the knowledge bestowed upon them. Gradually, stage by stage, generation after generation. Through the demise of illustrious scholars <span class="small-word">[ii]</span>, and those who have emerged later have become strangers <span class="small-word">[iii]</span>, even rejected by the majority of that community <span class="small-word">[iv]</span>. For souls distant from the authentic teachings of Rasulullah ﷺ, cannot discern the true scholars from the false <span class="small-word">[v]</span>.</p>

<h3>The Knowledge</h3>
         <p>Another reason why society remains inattentive during that challenging period is because new branches of knowledge keep emerging and growing right before their eyes, making it difficult to fully comprehend the situation. This has been mentioned by Rasulullah ﷺ in <i>Sunan an-Nasa’i</i> 4456: <b>وَيَظْهَرَ الْعِلْمُ</b>, <b>“and the emergence of knowledge.”</b> Does the saying contradict the hadith discussed here? No, because upon careful examination, we will find that both are addressing two different types of knowledge. As mentioned in the previous article, <i>The Challenge of Science and Technology</i>, and based on evidence such as Verse 7 of Surah ar-Rum and <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2722 – knowledge is divided into <b>two types</b>.</p>
         <p>The first is <b>beneficial knowledge</b>. It is the divine knowledge, commonly known as religious knowledge, namely the Quran & Sunnah, the words of Allah and the words of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. And other knowledge that possesses or establishes a connection with divine knowledge. It brings both, worldly benefits and, most importantly, benefits in the hereafter. This is the type of <b>knowledge that is taken away</b>. The second is futile knowledge. It does not establish any connection with divine knowledge, and only generates worldly benefits, disregarding the benefits in the hereafter. This is the <b>knowledge that widely spreads in the end times</b>. It is crucial to remember that the same knowledge can be either beneficial or futile. For instance, if cosmology becomes a means for one to draw closer to Allah (AWJ), it becomes beneficial. Conversely, it can be otherwise.</p>
<h4>يَعْلَمُونَ ظَٰهِرًا مِّنَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ هُمْ غَٰفِلُونَ </h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>They only know but a surface understanding of worldly affairs of this life, yet towards the realm of the hereafter, they remain heedless.</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Ar-Rum 30:7</p>
