        <p>This hadith conveys a deeply troubling era, where many among this ummah will face what is considered the gravest of fitnas, as stated by Hudhayfah al-Yaman (RA) in <i>Musnad Ibn Abi Shaybah</i> 37569 – the inability to distinguish between good and bad. Otherwise, they would never resort to ignorant figures as their sources of guidance. Indeed, this khabar deserves serious attention, for it shall not occur after the times of Imam Mahdi and Prophet Jesus (AS), as elucidated in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2937, that every Muslim shall depart from this mortal realm before the Hour. It may have already transpired, or is presently unfolding, unbeknownst to the masses. <b>الله أعلم</b>.</p>
<h4>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ انْتِزَاعًا يَنْتَزِعُهُ مِنَ الْعِبَادِ وَلَكِنْ يَقْبِضُ الْعِلْمَ بِقَبْضِ الْعُلَمَاءِ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Indeed, Allah does not take away knowledge abruptly, snatching it away from His servants. Rather, He takes away knowledge through the grasp of scholars.”</b></p>
<h3>The Grasp of Scholars</h3>
         <p>Even at the time of its occurrence, people tend to perceive it as a tale from a distant period, yet to come. This misunderstanding stems from the misinterpretation of the statement <b>“when no knowledgeable individual remains,”</b> leading to the mistaken belief that it implies the demise of all scholars on Earth. Is this truly the case? According to Ar-Raghib al-Isfahani (RH) in his work <i>Al-Mufradat fi Gharib il-Quran</i>, <b>القَبْضُ</b> sometimes carries a metaphorical connotation associated with <b>“death,”</b> as exemplified in the phrase <b>قَبَضَهُ اللّٰهُ</b>, which means <b>“being taken by Allah’s grasp.”</b> However, it is important to note that death is not necessarily the only interpretation for the meaning of <b>القَبْضُ</b> or <b>“the grasp”</b> in this hadith.</p>
         <p>It can also carry the meaning of <b>“withhold,”</b> as shown in the Quran, such as in Verse 245 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>وَٱللَّهُ يَقْبِضُ وَيَبْصُۜطُ</b>, which means <b>“and it is Allah who withholds or grants abundance.”</b> By not limiting the interpretation of “the grasp” solely to death, we can explore the depth of this hadith from a more expansive standpoint. Therefore, we can discern that the saying of Nabi ﷺ <b>“when no knowledgeable individual remains”</b> can also mean that the scholars, in reality, persist but are deliberately “withheld” or “kept away from the public.” This notion is supported by his statement in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 2484, which indicates the presence of scholars in every generation until the time of Antichrist.</p>
         <p>With the support of other relevant hadiths, we are now able to grasp this heart-rending tale with profound insight and comprehension. It is a tale of a community enamored by worldly affairs rather than the hereafter [i]. This led Allah (SWT) to reclaim the knowledge bestowed upon them. Gradually, stage by stage, generation after generation. Through the demise of illustrious scholars [ii], and those who have emerged later have become strangers [iii], even rejected by the majority of that community [iv]. For souls distant from the authentic teachings of Rasulullah ﷺ, cannot discern the true scholars from the false [v].</p>
