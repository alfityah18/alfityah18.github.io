<h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The term <b>الفَتْنُ</b> originates from a metallurgical process used to purify precious metals such as gold and silver, known as “fire refining” or “purification through smelting.” This method involves heating these metals to high temperatures, allowing impurities to oxidise and separate from the pure metal.</p>
        <p>It then evolved into various words that preserve this fundamental meaning, adapting to different contexts while remaining inherently interconnected. In the Quran, the trilateral root <b>ف ت ن</b> appears sixty times in five different forms: <b>فَتَنَ</b> twenty-three times, <b>فُتون</b> once, <b>فاتِن</b> once, <b>مَفْتون</b> once, and <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> thirty-four times.</p>
        <p>Among the meanings derived from this root in the Quran is “torment”, as exemplified in Verses 13 and 14 of Surah adh-Dhariyat: <b>“That Day is the Day when they will be TORMENTED over the Fire. ‘Taste your TORMENT! This is what you sought to hasten.’”</b> Here, the meaning of “torment” in the word <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> closely reflects its original sense—”burning,” as in the process of purification through fire.</p>
        <p>From there, it came to denote anything that could bring torment or harm. This is evident in Verse 101 of Surah an-Nisa: <b>“And when you travel through the land, there is no sin upon you in shortening the prayer if you fear being ATTACKED by the disbelievers.”</b> Specifically, in this context, torment or harm is expressed through an “attack” or a “disruption of peace.”</p>
        <p>Another example is found in Verse 10 of Surah al-Buruj, where <b>فَتَنَ</b> is used to mean “persecution,” “oppression,” “torture,” and “killing.” Meanwhile, <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> in Verse 47 of Surah at-Taubah conveys the meanings of “dissension,” “chaos,” “internal conflict,” and “public disorder.” Additionally, <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> is also used to signify “treachery,” “betrayal,” and “rebellion,” as seen in Verse 14 of Surah al-Ahzab.</p>
        <p>Beyond outward harm, the term is also used to denote inward harm. In verse 91 of Surah An-Nisa, Allah (SWT) says: <b>“You will find others who wish to be safe from you and safe from their own people. Yet whenever they are drawn back into FITNA, they plunge headlong into it.”</b> This Verse speaks about the hypocrites, and here, “fitna” refers to “shirk”—the most perilous harm to one’s creed.</p>
        <p>Moreover, “fitnah” is not limited to anything or anyone that brings torment or harm; it also includes a “temptation” that leads one away from faith and conviction. Allah says in Verse 49 of Surah al-Maidah: <b>“And judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires. And beware, lest they TEMPT YOU AWAY from some of what Allah has revealed to you.”</b></p>
        <p>“Temptation” can also be understood as “deception,” “delusion,” “misguidance,” or “corruption” (of one’s relationship with their Lord), as exemplified in Verses 162–163 of Surah as-Saffat. Meanwhile, a person who falls into deception, succumbs to temptation, or becomes afflicted by fitna is described as being “mad,” as seen in Verses 5–6 of Surah al-Qalam. This is because their soul is suffering torment and harm inflicted by Shaytan—whether from among the jinn or humans—even if they are unaware of it.</p>
