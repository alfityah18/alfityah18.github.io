        <p>Most of us are familiar with the Quranic Verse that states: <b>“Fitna is more dangerous than killing,”</b> quoted from either Verse 191 or Verse 217 of Surah al-Baqarah. However, in our country, “fitna” is often understood in the Malay language, where it means “a fabricated accusation intended to tarnish or bring ruin upon someone.”</p>
        <p>It is important to understand that the Malay language has borrowed many words from other languages, and these words have often evolved from their original meanings. This includes “fitna,” which is derived from Arabic. When discussing Quranic Verses or hadith, we must understand them in their original context—that is, in the Arabic of the Quran or Classical Arabic. Therefore, let us seek to learn the true meaning of the word “fitna.”</p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The term <b>الفَتْنُ</b> originates from a metallurgical process used to purify precious metals such as gold and silver, known as “fire refining” or “purification through smelting.” This method involves heating these metals to high temperatures, allowing impurities to oxidise and separate from the pure metal.</p>
        <p>It then evolved into various words that preserve this fundamental meaning, adapting to different contexts while remaining inherently interconnected. In the Quran, the trilateral root <b>ف ت ن</b> appears sixty times in five different forms: <b>فَتَنَ</b> twenty-three times, <b>فُتون</b> once, <b>فاتِن</b> once, <b>مَفْتون</b> once, and <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> thirty-four times.</p>
        <p>Among the meanings derived from this root in the Quran is “torment,” as exemplified in Verses 13 and 14 of Surah adh-Dhariyat: <b>“That Day is the Day when they will be TORMENTED over the Fire. ‘Taste your TORMENT! This is what you sought to hasten.’”</b> Here, the meaning of “torment” in the word <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> closely reflects its original sense—“burning,” as in the process of purification through fire.</p>
        <p>From there, it came to denote anything that could bring torment or harm. This is evident in Verse 101 of Surah an-Nisa: <b>“And when you travel through the land, there is no sin upon you in shortening the prayer if you fear being ATTACKED by the disbelievers.”</b> Specifically, in this context, torment or harm is expressed through an “attack” or a “disruption of peace.”</p>
        <p>Another example is found in Verse 10 of Surah al-Buruj, where <b>فَتَنَ</b> is used to mean “persecution,” “oppression,” “torture,” and “killing.” Meanwhile, <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> in Verse 47 of Surah at-Taubah conveys the meanings of “dissension,” “chaos,” “internal conflict,” and “public disorder.” Additionally, <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> is also used to signify “treachery,” “betrayal,” and “rebellion,” as seen in Verse 14 of Surah al-Ahzab.</p>
        <p>Beyond outward harm, the term is also used to denote inward harm. In verse 91 of Surah An-Nisa, Allah (SWT) says: <b>“You will find others who wish to be safe from you and safe from their own people. Yet whenever they are drawn back into FITNA, they plunge headlong into it.”</b> This Verse speaks about the hypocrites, and here, “fitna” refers to “shirk”—the most perilous harm to one’s creed.</p>
        <p>Moreover, “fitnah” is not limited to anything or anyone that brings torment or harm; it also includes a “temptation” that leads one away from faith and conviction. Allah says in Verse 49 of Surah al-Maidah: <b>“And judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires. And beware, lest they TEMPT YOU AWAY from some of what Allah has revealed to you.”</b></p>
        <p>“Temptation” can also be understood as “deception,” “delusion,” “misguidance,” or “corruption” (of one’s relationship with their Lord), as exemplified in Verses 162–163 of Surah as-Saffat. Meanwhile, a person who falls into deception, succumbs to temptation, or becomes afflicted by fitna is described as being “mad,” as seen in Verses 5–6 of Surah al-Qalam. This is because their soul is suffering torment and harm inflicted by Shaytan—whether from among the jinn or humans—even if they are unaware of it.</p>
        <p>All the previously mentioned meanings—some of which have been rendered with slight variations by different translators but remain fundamentally aligned—ultimately converge into their core essence: “trial,” “test,” and “tribulation.” This is the most predominant meaning found in the Book of Allah, accounting for over sixty per cent of its occurrences.</p>
        <p>This meaning functions similarly to the word <b>البَلَاءُ</b>, which means “trial” or “calamity.” Both terms appear together in Verse 35 of Surah al-Anbiya: <b>“And We will TEST you with evil and good as a TRIAL.”</b> This Verse highlights that a test from Allah is not limited to hardship; it can also come in the form of ease. Just as suffering can lead to disbelief or despair, prosperity can lead to arrogance and heedlessness.</p>
        <p>Trials are among the very reasons for our creation, as stated by Allah in Verse 2 of Surah al-Insan. As further affirmed in Verses 2–3 of Surah al-'Ankabut, the purpose of these trials is to distinguish between those who truly believe and those who are in denial.</p> 
        <p>In line with the original meaning of “fitna,” the trials one endures serve to “oxidise” sins, as mentioned by Rasulullah ﷺ  in the hadith recorded in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 5641. Moreover, those who succeed in these trials will have their ranks elevated until they become as pure as refined precious metal, as stated in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2572, and will be rewarded with Paradise, whereas those who fail will be “burned” in the Fire.</p>
        <p>In the preeminent classical Arabic lexicon of the Quran, <i>Al-Mufradat fi Gharib il-Quran,</i> Ar-Raghib al-Isfahani (RH) explains that any “trial” from Allah is inherently infused with wisdom. However, when “fitna” originates from His creation—without any divine command—it is something that must be avoided. This is because it has the potential to “burn away” one’s resilience in faith, as affirmed in His words: <b>“Fitna is more dangerous than killing.”</b></p>
<h3>Application</h3>
        <p>Only after understanding the meaning of “fitnah” in the Arabic of the Quran can we properly comprehend the hadith being discussed here. The “fitnah” in question is best understood as follows: <b>“A trial that carries the temptation, to lure someone away from the Path of God, harming faith, endangering creed, and corrupting religion—ultimately resulting in their torment in the Fire of Hell.”</b></p>
        <p>Therefore, let us reflect upon the words of the Prophet ﷺ in <i>Sunan Abu Dawud</i> 4263, the focal point of our discussion. There, we find that he repeated the statement, <b>“The truly fortunate is the one who is kept away from fitan”</b> three times. Why is this so? In his tafsir, Imam Al-Qurtubi (RH) explains that the majority of semantic scholars affirm that, in Arab linguistic tradition, repetition is a method used to emphasise and reinforce understanding of the subject being conveyed.</p>
        <p>The emphasis in this statement is on the importance of distancing oneself from the dangers of fitna. This aligns with the words of Allah (AWJ) in Verse 195 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>“And do not let your own hands throw you into destruction,”</b> as well as the saying of Al-Mustafa ﷺ in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2254: <b>“It is not befitting for a believer to humiliate himself.”</b> The Companions asked how a person might disgrace himself, to which he replied: <b>“By exposing himself to trials that he cannot bear.”</b></p>
        <p>The use of passive sentence here reflects the essence of <b>لَا ‌حَوْلَ ‌وَلَا ‌قُوَّةَ ‌إِلَّا ‌بِاللَّهِ,</b> <b>“There is no power nor strength except with Allah,”</b> an affirmation of Tawhid as a reminder that, while one may strive to avoid fitna, true fortune and safety are, in reality, granted by Allah. Moreover, it is an expression of proper etiquette, attributing all credit to Allah (SWT), as stated in His words in Verse 79 of Surah an-Nisa: <b>“Whatever good befalls you is from Allah, and whatever evil befalls you is from yourself.”</b></p>
        <p>Then, for the one who is tested, he is commanded to face it with patience. Regardless of the situation, a believer is always in a state of fortune, as mentioned by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2999: <b>“How wondrous is the affair of the believer! There is good for him in every matter—and this is not the case for anyone except the believer. If prosperity befalls him, he is grateful, and that is good for him. And if adversity befalls him, he is patient, and that is good for him.”</b></p>
        <p>To ensure that we truly understand the hadith under discussion, we must apply its core essence to other hadiths on fitan. For this, we will use a hadith narrated by Ibn ‘Umar (RA) in <i>Musnad al-Bazzar</i> 6192, which has been deemed as sahih by Shaykh Al-Albani (RH). The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p>
<h4>مَا ذِئْبَانِ ضَارِيَانِ فِي حَظِيرَةٍ يَأْكُلانِ وَيُفْسِدَانِ بِأَضَرَّ فِيهَا مِنْ حُبِّ الشَّرَفِ وَحُبِّ الْمَالِ فِي دِينِ الْمَرْءِ الْمُسْلِمِ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Two ravenous wolves that devour and destroy a flock of sheep are not nearly as dangerous as the harm caused by the love of status and riches to the faith of a Muslim.”</b></p>
        <p>As highlighted in the previous article, <i>In Times of Scarce Scholars,</i> we have been raised in a culture that glorifies celebrity status, where the world around us constantly reinforces the notion that aspiring to fame and boasting of a life of luxury and grandeur is entirely acceptable. This, compounded by a religious upbringing that remains a mere inherited tradition rather than one truly understood, has shaped a perception that is no longer subject to question. Yet, as the Prophet ﷺ cautioned, the love of status and wealth is a threat to one's religious life.</p>
        <p>In <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2965, when Ar-Rasul ﷺ stated that Allah loves His servant who does not seek to be known, it serves as a reminder of the grave danger of seeking recognition, as it distances a person from the mercy of their Lord. It also erodes the sweetness of love for the Hereafter, as Bishr ibn al-Harith (RH) expressed in <i>At-Tawaddu’ wal-Khumul</i> 72. Moreover, as the Prophet ﷺ stated in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 6060, the love of praise can ruin a person’s heart. Furthermore, as the Prophet ﷺ stated in <i>Sunan Abu Dawud</i> 5229, the love of being honoured by others darkens one’s future in the Hereafter.</p>
        <p>The words of Rasulullah ﷺ in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2336: <b>“Every Ummah has its trial, and the trial of my Ummah is wealth,”</b> alongside his statement in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 3241: <b>“I looked into Paradise and found that the majority of its inhabitants were the poor,”</b> highlight the grave danger that wealth presents. While wealth itself is not inherently evil, its trial is immense. Allah warns in Verses 6–7 of Surah al-‘Alaq that when a person sees himself as self-sufficient, he transgresses all bounds—becoming heedless of life's true purpose.</p>
        <p>When love becomes too deep, it drives a person into the depths of avarice. They grow resentful when their titles are not acknowledged or when they feel their status is not honoured—this is a severe stage. At this point, faith is already lost, as Rasulullah ﷺ stated in <i>Sunan an-Nasai</i> 3111: <b>“Avarice and faith cannot coexist in the heart of a servant.”</b> The love of status and wealth is part of the love of the world, and the love of the world leads to Hell, as conveyed in Verse 57 of Surah al-Hadid. Even more dangerous is when religious figures display such love, for it tarnishes the reputation of this sacred faith.</p>
        <p>Now that we understand the love of status and wealth as a fitnah to be avoided, what about patience in this regard? One who is granted position and riches is not necessarily bound to love them. Here, patience means restraining oneself from becoming attached to them. By doing so, one can lead a righteous life, using these blessings as an investment for the Hereafter and for the cause of Allah—aligning with the teachings of Verse 88 of Surah al-Hijr and Verse 15 of Surah al-Mulk.</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>Applying the hadith under discussion to the hadith of the two wolves has allowed us to perceive the dangers of fitnah with even greater clarity. However, the question remains—how can one safeguard oneself from it?</p>
        <p>The first step is to seek knowledge, as reflected in the words of Hudhayfah (RA) in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 1847, where he expressed his fear of being afflicted by fitnah. Secondly, to attain Allah’s protection, one must have faith and place complete reliance upon Him, as explained in Verse 99 of Surah an-Nahl. The third is ikhlas—remaining free from all forms of shirk, as taught in Verses 40–41 of Surah al-Hijr. Fourth, one must engage frequently in the remembrance of Allah, as stated by Rasulullah ﷺ in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2863. Lastly, one must remain with Al-Jama'ah, as the Prophet ﷺ advised in <i>Sahih Ibn Hibban</i> 4577, and adhere to the path of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his Companions, as emphasised in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2641.</p>
