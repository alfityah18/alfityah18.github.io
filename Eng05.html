<h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The term <b>الفَتْنُ</b> originates from a metallurgical process used to purify precious metals such as gold and silver, known as “fire refining” or “purification through smelting.” This method involves heating these metals to high temperatures, allowing impurities to oxidise and separate from the pure metal.</p>
        <p>It then evolved into various words that preserve this fundamental meaning, adapting to different contexts while remaining inherently interconnected. In the Quran, the trilateral root <b>ف ت ن</b> appears sixty times in five different forms: <b>فَتَنَ</b> twenty-three times, <b>فُتون</b> once, <b>فاتِن</b> once, <b>مَفْتون</b> once, and <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> thirty-four times.</p>
        <p>Among the meanings derived from this root in the Quran is “torment”, as exemplified in Verses 13 and 14 of Surah adh-Dhariyat: <b>“That Day is the Day when they will be TORMENTED over the Fire. ‘Taste your TORMENT! This is what you sought to hasten.’”</b> Here, the meaning of “torment” in the word <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> closely reflects its original sense.</p>
        <p>From there, it came to denote anything that could bring torment or any form of harm. This is evident in Verse 101 of Surah an-Nisa: <b>”And when you travel through the land, there is no sin upon you in shortening the prayer if you fear being ATTACKED by the disbelievers.”</b> Specifically, in this context, “torment” refers to “attack.”</p>
        <p>Beyond outward harm, the term is also used to denote inward harm. In verse 91 of Surah An-Nisa, Allah the Almighty says: <b>“You will find others who wish to be safe from you and safe from their own people. Yet whenever they are drawn back into fitna, they plunge headlong into it.”</b> Here, “fitna” refers to “shirk”—the most perilous harm to one’s creed.</p>
