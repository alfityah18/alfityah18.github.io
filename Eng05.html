<h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>The term <b>الفَتْنُ</b> originates from a metallurgical process used to purify precious metals such as gold and silver, known as “fire refining” or “purification through smelting.” This method involves heating these metals to high temperatures, allowing impurities to oxidise and separate from the pure metal.</p>
        <p>It then evolved into various words that preserve this fundamental meaning, adapting to different contexts while remaining inherently interconnected. In the Quran, the trilateral root <b>ف ت ن</b> appears sixty times in five different forms: <b>فَتَنَ</b> twenty-three times, <b>فُتون</b> once, <b>فاتِن</b> once, <b>مَفْتون</b> once, and <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> thirty-four times.</p>
        <p>Among the meanings derived from this root in the Quran is “torment”, as exemplified in Verses 13 and 14 of Surah adh-Dhariyat: <b>“That Day is the Day when they will be TORMENTED over the Fire. ‘Taste your TORMENT! This is what you sought to hasten.’”</b> Here, the meaning of “torment” in the word <b>فِتْنةٌ</b> closely reflects its original sense.</p>
