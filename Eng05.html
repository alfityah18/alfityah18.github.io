        <p>In addition to the two guidances mentioned in the first part, this hadith also serves as a reminder not to be naive about the realities of worldly life – not all religious figures are scholars; indeed, not all are honest, true, and wise. Through Verse 2-3 of Surah al-Insan, Allah (SWT) explains that one of the purposes of our creation is to be tested, and thus we are given two choices – whether to follow the straight path or to deviate. Hence, religious figures also fall into these two categories. From rabbis and priests of the People of the Book who alter the laws of Allah, to the Hypocrites who feigned belief during the time of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, to the Innovators who emerged since the era of the Companions (RA) up to the present – misguided religious figures will always exist until the end of this temporal realm. This is the reality. Therefore, let us heed the details provided by Rasulullah ﷺ himself in <i>Musnad ash-Shamiyyin</i> 588, which has been deemed sahih by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (RH):</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“This knowledge will be upheld by the just across generations. They will protect it from the distortion of the extremists, the misrepresentation of the fabricators and the interpretation of the ignorants.”</b></p>

<h3>Contrasting Attributes: Khutaba vs Ulama</h3>
<h3>3. Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Imagine two clear bottles placed side by side. From a distance, they appear identical, each containing a clear, transparent liquid. However, only upon closer inspection—through smell or taste—can you discern their true nature. One bottle holds pure water, quenching one’s thirst and sustaining life. The other bottle contains rubbing alcohol, which, despite its pristine appearance, projects a pungent odour and is harmful if one ingested. Such is the analogy of the marfu’ hadith above. Broadly speaking, most of the bearers of religious knowledge either appear to base their knowledge on the Quran and Hadith or explicitly claim to do so. In reality, they are divided into two groups: only one is authentic, while the others deceive and bring harm; only one is true scholars, while the others are preachers of the age of Jahiliyyah*.</p>
<p class="small-text">*Read the first part of this article to understand the history of the Jahiliyyah-era preachers and the context of the comparison.</p>
        <p>Beyond <b>depth of knowledge</b>, another aspect that distinguishes true scholars from impostors is <b>how they approach religious knowledge</b>. Genuine scholars are <b>fair, honest, upright, and faithful to the Quran and Hadith</b>: they preserve these texts as they were revealed, inherited, and practised by the earliest generations, even safeguarding them from any form of corruption. Unlike worldly knowledge, which undergoes evolution, divine knowledge is already perfect, as stated by Allah (AWJ) in Verse 3 of Surah al-Maidah. Thus, something that has already attained a state of perfection risks disruption of its equilibrium and potential destruction if manipulated. As mentioned in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 1920, they will always be triumphant on the path of truth, and they are akin to the bottle that holds pure water required by this ummah.</p>
        <p>On the path of falsehood, there exist three groups of the Jahiliyyah-era preachers, regardless of their titles, certificates, influence, or even position. The first group comprises the ghuluw who tarnish the moderation of the way of life established by Allah. They result in ruin not only to matters of ibadah but also to aqidah, potentially leading to the collapse of tawhid, as indicated in Verse 77 of Surah al-Maidah. The second group consists of liars who treat religious knowledge as if it originates from them, prioritizing intellect, interpreting the Quran according to their desires, fabricating Hadith, and even inventing practices. And the third group is made up of the unintelligent and those with darkened hearts—camel calves being milked, lacking understanding, and failing to apply their knowledge—disseminating inaccuracies.</p>
        <p>However, differentiating those two bottles is not as straightforward as one might think. Through different texts in <i>Silsilah as-Sahihah</i> 3189 below, to distinguish knowledge in an era where true scholars are scarce and preachers are abundant, Rasulullah ﷺ explained that the <b>sensor</b> one must possess is the <b>divine knowledge that enlightens the heart</b>. Nothing can evaluate knowledge except knowledge itself. This is crucial at a time when knowledge is becoming corrupted, and people start to regard preachers as scholars. Moreover, to be protected by Allah, knowledge must be pursued with <b>ikhlas</b>, as stated in Verse 40 of Surah al-Hijr. Those who practice knowledge can taste the difference between the bottles. Those who seek knowledge can smell their distinction. Those who disregard knowledge are prone to deception.</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“You are living in an era abundant with fuqaha yet scarce in khutaba. There are few beggars, yet many givers. Practicing deeds at this time is better than possessing knowledge.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“A time will come when fuqaha are scarce and khutaba are abundant. There will be many beggars, but few givers. Possessing knowledge at that time will be better than practicing deeds.”</b></p>
<h3>4. Akhlaq</h3>
        <p>When our mother ‘Aisyah (RA), through <i>Mishkat ul-Masabih</i> 1257, concluded that the character of the Prophet ﷺ was the Quran: scholars, the inheritors of the Prophets, should exemplify the finest character of their era, becoming pioneers in the compilation of manners, ethics, and all virtues advocated in the Book of Allah. However, as understood from ‘Umar (RA) in <i>Sunan al-Kubra</i> 20400, a person’s public persona does not really reflect their true character at home, as character can be performed for influence, as ‘Ali (RA) remarked in <i>Sunan ad-Darimi</i> 384. Nevertheless, we can discern their true nature through their <b>patience</b>, <b>caution</b>, and <b>humility</b> in educating this ummah, reflecting <b>true understanding</b>, as true understanding is a sign of being chosen by Allah, in line with the saying of An-Nabi ﷺ in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 1037.</p>
<h3>7 Characteristics of a Faqih</h3>
        <p>[1] <b>Does not hastily issue fatwas</b> as “the most hasty in issuing fatwas is the quickest to enter Hellfire” and because “haste is from Satan”;</p>
        <p>[2] <b>Does not issue fatwas based on merely personal reasoning, or without basis, or making the forbidden permissible and otherwise with vague reasoning</b> without guidance from the Quran and the Sunnah;</p>
        <p>[3] <b>Resolves issues according to a hierarchical order of reference</b>: the Quran, the Sunnah of Rasulullah ﷺ, consensus (of the Companions), and ijtihad;</p>
        <p>[4] <b>Postpones new issues</b> to consult experts, hold discussions, or conduct thorough research first, as “delaying is better”;</p>
