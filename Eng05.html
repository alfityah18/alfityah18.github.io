        <p>In addition to the two guidances mentioned in the first part, this hadith also serves as a reminder not to be naive about the realities of worldly life – not all religious figures are scholars; indeed, not all are honest, true, and wise. Through Verse 2-3 of Surah al-Insan, Allah (SWT) explains that one of the purposes of our creation is to be tested, and thus we are given two choices – whether to follow the straight path or to deviate. Hence, religious figures also fall into these two categories. From rabbis and priests of the People of the Book who alter the laws of Allah, to the Hypocrites who feigned belief during the time of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, to the Innovators who emerged since the era of the Companions (RA) up to the present – misguided religious figures will always exist until the end of this temporal realm. This is the reality. Therefore, let us heed the details provided by Rasulullah ﷺ himself in <i>Musnad ash-Shamiyyin</i> 588, which has been deemed sahih by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (RH):</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“This knowledge will be upheld by the just across generations. They will protect it from the distortion of the extremists, the misrepresentation of the fabricators and the interpretation of the ignorants.”</b></p>

<h3>Contrasting Attributes: Khutaba vs Ulama</h3>
<h3>3. Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Imagine two clear bottles placed side by side. From a distance, they appear identical, each containing a clear, transparent liquid. However, only upon closer inspection—through smell or taste—can you discern their true nature. One bottle holds pure water, quenching one’s thirst and sustaining life. The other bottle contains rubbing alcohol, which, despite its pristine appearance, projects a pungent odour and is harmful if one ingested. Such is the analogy of the marfu’ hadith above. Broadly speaking, most of the bearers of religious knowledge either appear to base their knowledge on the Quran and Hadith or explicitly claim to do so. In reality, they are divided into two groups: only one is authentic, while the others deceive and bring harm; only one is true scholars, while the others are preachers of the age of Jahiliyyah*.</p>
<p class="small-text">*Read the first part of this article to understand the history of the Jahiliyyah-era preachers and the context of the comparison.</p>
        <p>Beyond <b>depth of knowledge</b>, another aspect that distinguishes true scholars from impostors is <b>how they approach religious knowledge</b>. Genuine scholars are <b>fair, honest, upright, and faithful to the Quran and Hadith</b>: they preserve these texts as they were revealed, inherited, and practised by the earliest generations, even safeguarding them from any form of corruption. Unlike worldly knowledge, which undergoes evolution, divine knowledge is already perfect, as stated by Allah (AWJ) in Verse 3 of Surah al-Maidah. Thus, something that has already attained a state of perfection risks disruption of its equilibrium and potential destruction if manipulated. As mentioned in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 1920, they will always be triumphant on the path of truth, and they are akin to the bottle that holds pure water required by this ummah.</p>
