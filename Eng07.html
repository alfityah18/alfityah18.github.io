        <p>In the first article entitled <i>The Challenge of Science & Technology,</i> it is explained that this hadith refers to artificial intelligence (AI). It becomes a “predatory being” when misused by humans, potentially causing harm to individuals, society, and nations. As it matures alongside advancements in quantum science and neurology, one day we may witness our whips, shoelaces, and even our thighs literally speaking. الله أعلم.</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>What is to be focused on here is a growing issue that has only recently emerged, one that could potentially bring disastrous consequences to our community—“Sheikh GPT.” This refers to the misuse of generative AI, where people have started to rely on tools like ChatGPT, Grok, or Gemini as their religious reference. In fact, there are already instances where religious content is being generated entirely using these AI tools, with the intention of using it for preaching. I have witnessed it firsthand.</p>
        <p>We cannot deny the benefits of this technology. In fact, I personally use it myself. As someone balancing work and conducting in-depth research on religious studies, AI has been immensely helpful in producing articles and videos related to Islam. However, I use it only in moderation and for the tasks it is suited for, such as website development, refining English translations, and using AI voice narrators. All of this helps save time, effort, and money, especially for those of us who are less financially fortunate.</p>
        <p>The first article and video also warned about the fitna that some branches of science and technology may bring. And the meaning of “fitna” in Classical Arabic was further elaborated in the article titled <i>Fitna.</i> In the context of “Sheikh GPT,” fitna arises from a lack of knowledge in science and technology, as well as a lack of understanding of religious knowledge. In Verse 36 of Surah al-Isra, Allah (SWT) says:</p>
<h4>وَلَا تَقۡفُ مَا لَيۡسَ لَكَ بِهِۦ عِلۡمٌۚ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Do not follow what you have no (sure) knowledge of.</b></p>
        <p>This Verse teaches us the importance of equipping ourselves with sufficient knowledge before engaging in any matter. We should avoid acting hastily, for as Rasulullah ﷺ said in <i>Musnad Abi Ya’la</i> 4256, haste is from Satan. Additionally, the Quranic Verse reminds us that our hearing, sight, and hearts will be held accountable.</p>
        <p>To those who have elevated generative AI as their “sheikh,” ask yourself these three questions. First: Do you truly understand the characteristics of generative AI to the point that you would trust it as a reliable source of religious knowledge? Second: What evidence supports the notion that generative AI is a knowledgeable entity in matters of this faith? And third: Have you consulted scholars and obtained their approval to allow generative AI to assume their role?</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>Let us take a moment to reflect on the answer to these three questions. First, the credibility of generative AI as a source that can be trusted without doubt. In an interview on a social media platform, Dr. Waleed Kadous, Chief Scientist at Anyscale and a renowned expert in artificial intelligence and machine learning with over fifteen years of experience in Silicon Valley, was asked whether he trusts the information generated by AI. His response was a firm “no.” One of the main reasons he cited was "hallucination."</p>
        <p>“Hallucination” in artificial intelligence refers to the phenomenon where AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, generate information that appears plausible but is, in fact, incorrect or entirely fabricated. This happens because these models are probabilistic in nature, relying on patterns learned from data without truly understanding the information they generate.</p>
        <p>AI does not know that it does not know. As a result, sometimes, they can “make things up” confidently because they are unaware of their own lack of knowledge. In their blog, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, wrote on November 30, 2022:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.”</b></p>
        <p>In the MIT Technology Review newsletter titled <i>It’s Time to Talk About the Real AI Risks,</i> published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on June 12, 2023, senior reporter Tate Ryan-Mosley expressed concerns about the issue of hallucinations in artificial intelligence that might not be fixable. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, addressed this issue during an interview with CBS on April 16, 2023, stating:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“No one in the field has yet solved the hallucination problems. All models do have this as an issue.”</b></p>    
        <p>Although there have been various claims that the issue of hallucinations in AI can be addressed, after years of development and as of the writing of this article, the problem remains far from fully resolved. Despite advancements in training data, algorithms, and fine-tuning methods, AI systems can still produce inaccurate and misleading information.</p>    
        <p>In conclusion, AI should not be considered a reliable source of religious knowledge that can be trusted without doubt. In the field of hadith studies, when a narrator is found to have lied—even if the lie was not in their specific narrations—all of their hadiths are classified as “matruk” or abandoned. Therefore, genAI chatbots like ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini, which have been proven to fabricate responses and generate false information, must be disregarded when it comes to religious matters.</p>
        <p>Now, let us now examine an example of a potential danger to the Muslim community. Although this scenario is fictional, it is entirely plausible within our society.</p>
        <p>X asks ChatGPT to generate a brief religious essay, which X then shares on social media, attributing it to himself as the author. Seeing the positive feedback, X becomes increasingly eager to produce more. One day, without realising it—due to never having verified the information or even knowing how to properly check it, as he has never studied religious matters—X unknowingly disseminates a fabricated hadith created by the chatbot, falsely attributing it to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.</p>
        <p>Let us now examine the mistakes made by X.</p> 
        <p>1. Plagiarism. In <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 6094, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: <b>“Lying leads to wickedness, and wickedness leads to the Hellfire.”</b></p>
        <p>2. The Prophet ﷺ said in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 5: <b>“It is sufficient for a person to be regarded as a liar if he narrates whatever he hears (without verifying it first).”</b></p>
        <p>3. Ibn Taymiyyah (RH) in <i>Majmoo’ al-Fatawa</i> 10/449, stated: <b>“Whoever speaks about Islam without knowledge is a liar, even if they do not intend to lie.”</b></p>
        <p>4. In <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 107, the Messenger ﷺ said: <b>“Whoever tells a lie against me, let him occupy his seat in the Hellfire.”</b></p>
        <p>5. When a person who reads his essay practices the fabricated act, the Chosen One ﷺ said in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 1017: <b>“Whoever establishes an evil practice in Islam will have its burden and the burden of those who act upon it after him, without their burdens being diminished in any way.”</b></p>
        <p>Therefore, be cautious.</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>To answer the second question—whether artificial intelligence can be regarded as a knowledgeable entity in matters of religion—we must refer back to my article titled <i>When Knowledge is Taken Away.</i> In addition to the issue of “hallucination” already discussed, those who have read the article and been granted understanding by Allah (AWJ) should, by now, be able to discern the answer to this “Sheikh GPT” dilemma. Before we go any further, let us first clarify what AI actually is. Marvin Minsky, one of the founding fathers, explained:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by humans.”</b></p>
        <p>This highlights that AI performs tasks traditionally associated with human intelligence. If we then consider the <i>Oxford Dictionary of English,</i> which defines a knowledgeable person as someone intelligent and well-informed, it follows that AI could be seen as a knowledgeable entity. Is this truly the case? In Verse 28 of Surah Fatir, our Lord says:</p>
<h4>إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى ٱللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ٱلْعُلَمَٰٓؤُا۟</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Indeed, of all of His servants, those who truly FEAR Allah are only the ulama.</b></p>
        <p>Al-Quran was revealed as “Al-Furqan,” “The Criterion,” or “The Discernment”—a fundamental standard that distinguishes between right from wrong. While the West defines knowledge solely through the faculties of the mind, and the general public tends to judge by outward measures, Al-Quran defines the knowledgeable by something both the West and many others overlook: what lies within the most precious of all—the heart.</p>
        <p>Evidence of the importance of the heart can be seen in Verse 70 of Surah al-Anfal, where Allah (SWT) says, which means: <b>“If Allah knows of goodness in your hearts, He will give you better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you.”</b> Furthermore, in a narration by Abu Hurairah (RA), recorded in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2564, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: <b>“Allah does not look at your appearance or wealth, but rather He looks at your hearts and deeds.”</b></p>
        <p>Based on the words of ‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud (RA) in <i>Rawdatul ‘Uqala</i> 9, and Verse 28 of Surah Fatir mentioned earlier, those who are knowledgeable are not merely individuals who store vast amounts of information in their minds, but rather those who, with knowledge, have pure and noble feelings formed in their hearts—especially الْخَشْيَةُ, which is deep awe, directed towards The Almighty. These are the ones Allah refers to as the ulama.</p>
        <p>This is sufficient to provide the answer: that artificial intelligence—which has no heart or feelings, no taqwa or faith, has never prayed or fasted, never engaged in dhikr, never wept while reciting the Quran as others slept soundly, nor felt awe towards its Lord upon witnessing His greatness in His creations—is not a knowledgeable entity.</p>
        <p>The same applies to human beings. Those who, despite possessing knowledge as high as mountains, are called “walking encyclopaedias,” and admired by millions, yet whose knowledge brings no positive effect to their hearts—are not truly ulama.</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>After answering those two questions, the inquiry as to whether AI is fit to assume the role of the ulama should already be sufficiently addressed. Through the narration of Anas ibn Malik (RA), as recorded in <i>Musnad ash-Shihab</i> 115 compiled by Al-Qadi Al-Quda’i (RH), and authenticated by Al-Imam As-Suyuti (RH), Rasulullah ﷺ said:</p>
<h4>الْعُلَمَاءُ أُمَنَاءُ اللَّهِ عَلَى خَلْقِهِ</h4>        
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“The scholars are Allah’s trustees over His creation.”</b></p> 
        <p>The ulama are a group entrusted by Allah with the responsibility of safeguarding the inheritance left to the ummah. However, as the Prophet ﷺ stated in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 3641, this inheritance is not material wealth, but knowledge inherited from the Prophets.</p>
        <p>In Verse 30 of Surah al-Baqarah, Allah the Most High proclaims that the authority on this earth is the human being—not AI. As stated in Verse 4 of Surah at-Tin, mankind is His best creation, particularly those who believe and perform righteous deeds, as clarified in Verse 7 of Surah Al-Bayyinah.</p>
        <p>One of the reasons AI is referred to as a “predatory being” in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2181 is because it ensnares mankind into admiring the progress of human science and technology. A heart that is truly anchored in tawhid will not be easily awed by man-made creations. Its wonder is reserved only for Al-Khāliq—the Most Perfect Creator who brings forth existence from non-existence.</p>
        <p>The so-called “greatness” of science and technology, which Allah has granted to mankind today, is nothing but a trial. Whatever promises or lofty ambitions the scientists and technologists many admire may put forward, they will never be able to truly create—even something exactly like a fly, as stated in Allah’s challenge in Verse 73 of Surah al-Hajj. Artificial intelligence can never rival the intelligence of the best of all creation—human beings.</p>
        <p>As the best of all creation, it is only fitting that the structure of society ordained by Allah for us is also the most excellent. In matters of religion, as recorded in <i>Az-Zuhd wal-Raqā’iq</i> 801, Ibn Mas’ud (RA) said:</p>
<h4>لا يَزَالُ النَّاسُ بِخَيْرٍ مَا أَتَاهُمُ الْعِلْمُ مِنْ قِبَلِ أَصْحَابِ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وَأَكَابِرِهِمْ فَإِذَا أَتَاهُمُ الْعِلْمُ مِنْ قِبَلِ أَصَاغِرِهِمْ فَذَلِكَ حِينَ هَلَكُوا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“People will remain upon goodness for as long as they take knowledge from the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ and their senior scholars. But when they begin to take knowledge from their lesser ones, that is when they will be ruined.”</b></p>
        <p>Seeking knowledge from the senior scholars is a Sunnah. If acquiring religious knowledge from those who lack true understanding can bring harm to society, then how much greater is the risk when relying on artificial intelligence? Some of you may not see it, but it can lead to immense danger.</p>
        <p>Do you know what sparked the seeds of deviation in the Khawarij? They were known for memorising the Quran, performing night prayers, and observing voluntary fasts. Yet, their error began when they detached themselves from the senior scholars among the Companions (RA) and chose instead to learn solely among themselves. This led to the emergence of ideas that strayed far from the principles of Ahlus Sunnah.</p>
        <p>Just as the Khawarij fell into misguidance by severing ties with the inheritors of the Prophets, a similar danger looms when people turn away from living scholarship in favour of algorithmic guidance lacking spiritual depth and human wisdom. Now, are you willing to risk your faith?</p>
        <p>We do not know what else science and technology will bring. Will it be a leap forward? Or could it, in fact, be what the Chosen One ﷺ described in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2181 as a sign of the end of true progress? Yet know this: when the ummah increasingly sidelines its scholars—as foretold by the Prophet ﷺ in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 100—more and more scholars will be taken away. Whether through death. Or by being cast into isolation.</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>In past centuries, many would have imagined this being as a “wild beast” or some kind of “monster.” Yet today, as it becomes a reality before our very eyes, we find that it is something entirely different. Who would have thought that it would, in fact, be artificial intelligence? This serves as a lesson that, apart from Allah, human beings have no knowledge of the future. And when such a matter is mentioned in the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ, it deserves our utmost attention.</p>
        <p>What ought to be emphasised is the guidance itself, in which Rasulullah ﷺ described that being—which we now understand as AI—as a predator. The earlier discussion on the “Sheikh GPT” issue is already sufficient to demonstrate that artificial intelligence, when misused, becomes predatory. Yet it does not end there. Let us now examine the further harm it brings.</p>
        <p>Tristan Harris, former Google Design Ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, has warned that social media is not merely a passive tool, but a system with its own goals, and it has its own means of pursuing them by using your psychology against you. In the Netflix documentary titled <i>The Social Dilemma,</i> released in 2020, he stated:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“If you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product.”</b></p>
        <p>You are not the customer—you are the product. The real customers are the advertisers, and what is being sold is human attention. These AI-driven algorithms are not neutral; they are designed to maximise your engagement by any means necessary. This includes exploiting emotions, deepening addictive behaviour, and ensuring that users keep coming back—because the longer you stay on their platform, the more ads they can show you.</p>
        <p>In fact, many features we now take for granted—such as infinite scrolling, autoplay, and constant notifications—were deliberately designed to mimic the addictive pull of slot machines. The true objective is not to inform, educate, or build, but simply to keep you hooked.</p>
        <p>This is one of the earliest examples of how AI, when left unchecked, becomes a predator of human behaviour—subtle in its approach, yet profound in its impact. As a result, time is now spent almost entirely on fulfilling personal desires. If even time for family has been reduced, then time for the needs of the ummah is even more neglected. Indeed, some have no time left at all to fulfil their obligations to their Lord. Through <i>Mustadrak al-Hakim</i> 7917, which was graded hasan by Sheikh Al-Albani (RH) in <i>Sahih al-Jami’</i> 1146, the Messenger ﷺ said:</p>
<h4>اقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ وَلَا يَزْدَادُ النَّاسُ عَلَى الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا حِرْصًا وَلَا يَزْدَادُونَ مِنَ اللَّهِ إِلَّا بُعْدًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“The Hour has drawn near, yet people grow only more attached to the world, and grow ever more distant from Allah.”</b></p>
        <p>In addition to encouraging time-wasting pursuits, AI can also become a predator that traps the uninformed into committing sin. The generation of images and videos has become increasingly popular, yet many remain unaware of the rulings concerning the creation of living forms—such as humans, animals, or imagined creatures. This is because we have been raised in an environment that imitates every inch of the Western way of life. Figure drawing, comics, and character animation have already become well-established practices.</p>
        <p>This falls under matters prohibited in Islam. In addition to being a practice rooted in Jahiliyyah, it is considered an attempt to rival the creation of Allah (SWT). The majority of scholars have declared it impermissible—even in incomplete forms—including the foremost scholars of the Shafi’i school. Although some, particularly contemporary scholars, have offered certain allowances, these are restricted to incomplete representations and only permitted for necessary purposes, such as in health and education.</p>
        <p>Through <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 5950, Ibn Mas’ud (RA) narrated that Rasulullah ﷺ said the people who will face the most severe punishment in Hell are those who create images of figures. And in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2109, Ibn ‘Abbas (RA) recorded the words of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, which read:</p>
<h4>كُلُّ مُصَوِّرٍ فِي النَّارِ يَجْعَلُ لَهُ بِكُلِّ صُورَةٍ صَوَّرَهَا نَفْسًا فَتُعَذِّبُهُ فِي جَهَنَّمَ</h4>        
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“All creators of figure images will be in Hell. A soul will be breathed into every figure they ever drew, and those figures will torment them in Jahannam.”</b></p>
        <p>Ibn ‘Abbas (RA) added that if one must do so, then let it be of trees and lifeless objects. However, most of the images and videos found on social media serve no real purpose—only for amusement, laughter, and the pursuit of likes.</p>
        <p>Then, when generated images and videos become excessively realistic, they give rise to a host of serious ethical and social concerns—such as defamation, fake news, misinformation, identity theft, and more. In fact, I have personally seen what someone had generated: the voice of a great religious scholar of our time who had already passed away. Truly a chilling reality.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the misuse of AI can also lead to extreme actions. Some of us have already come across generated videos in which a person appears to be swimming through the flames of Hell. If the one who created it is a Muslim—and the intent was to mock the warnings of Allah—then they have, in fact, departed from the fold of Islam. This is based on numerous Quranic Verses, including Verses 65 and 66 of Surah at-Taubah:</p>
<h4></h4>

<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>If you question them, they will certainly say, “We were only talking idly and joking around.” Say, “Was it Allah, and His Verses, and His Messenger that you ridiculed?”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Make no excuse! You have lost faith after your belief.</b></p>
