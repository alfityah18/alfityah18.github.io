        <p>In the first article entitled <i>The Challenge of Science & Technology,</i> it is explained that this hadith refers to artificial intelligence (AI). It becomes a “predatory being” when misused by humans, potentially causing harm to individuals, society, and nations. As it matures alongside advancements in quantum science and neurology, one day we may witness our whips, shoelaces, and even our thighs literally speaking. الله أعلم.</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>What is to be focused on here is a growing issue that has only recently emerged, one that could potentially bring disastrous consequences to our community—“Sheikh GPT.” This refers to the misuse of generative AI, where people have started to rely on tools like ChatGPT, Grok, or Gemini as their religious reference. In fact, there are already instances where religious content is being generated entirely using these AI tools, with the intention of using it for preaching. I have witnessed it firsthand.</p>
        <p>We cannot deny the benefits of this technology. In fact, I personally use it myself. As someone balancing work and conducting in-depth research on religious studies, AI has been immensely helpful in producing articles and videos related to Islam. However, I use it only in moderation and for the tasks it is suited for, such as website development, refining English translations, and using AI voice narrators. All of this helps save time, effort, and money, especially for those of us who are less financially fortunate.</p>
        <p>The first article and video also warned about the fitna that some branches of science and technology may bring. And the meaning of “fitna” in Classical Arabic was further elaborated in the article titled <i>Fitna.</i> In the context of “Sheikh GPT,” fitna arises from a lack of knowledge in science and technology, as well as a lack of understanding of religious knowledge. In Verse 36 of Surah al-Isra, Allah (SWT) says:</p>
<h4>وَلَا تَقۡفُ مَا لَيۡسَ لَكَ بِهِۦ عِلۡمٌۚ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Do not follow what you have no (sure) knowledge of.</b></p>
        <p>This Verse teaches us the importance of equipping ourselves with sufficient knowledge before engaging in any matter. We should avoid acting hastily, for as Rasulullah ﷺ said in <i>Musnad Abi Ya’la</i> 4256, haste is from Satan. Additionally, the Quranic Verse reminds us that our hearing, sight, and hearts will be held accountable.</p>
        <p>To those who have elevated generative AI as their “sheikh,” ask yourself these three questions. First: Do you truly understand the characteristics of generative AI to the point that you would trust it as a reliable source of religious knowledge? Second: What evidence supports the notion that generative AI is a knowledgeable entity in matters of this faith? And third: Have you consulted scholars and obtained their approval to allow generative AI to assume their role?</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>Let us take a moment to reflect on the answer to these three questions. First, the credibility of generative AI as a source that can be trusted without doubt. In an interview on a social media platform, Dr. Waleed Kadous, Chief Scientist at Anyscale and a renowned expert in artificial intelligence and machine learning with over fifteen years of experience in Silicon Valley, was asked whether he trusts the information generated by AI. His response was a firm “no.” One of the main reasons he cited was "hallucination."</p>
        <p>“Hallucination” in artificial intelligence refers to the phenomenon where AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, generate information that appears plausible but is, in fact, incorrect or entirely fabricated. This happens because these models are probabilistic in nature, relying on patterns learned from data without truly understanding the information they generate.</p>
        <p>AI does not know that it does not know. As a result, sometimes, they can “make things up” confidently because they are unaware of their own lack of knowledge. In their blog, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, wrote on November 30, 2022:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.”</b></p>
        <p>In the MIT Technology Review newsletter titled <i>It’s Time to Talk About the Real AI Risks,</i> published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on June 12, 2023, senior reporter Tate Ryan-Mosley expressed concerns about the issue of hallucinations in artificial intelligence that might not be fixable. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, addressed this issue during an interview with CBS on April 16, 2023, stating:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“No one in the field has yet solved the hallucination problems. All models do have this as an issue.”</b></p>    
        <p>Although there have been various claims that the issue of hallucinations in AI can be addressed, after years of development and as of the writing of this article, the problem remains far from fully resolved. Despite advancements in training data, algorithms, and fine-tuning methods, AI systems can still produce inaccurate and misleading information.</p>    
        <p>In conclusion, AI should not be considered a reliable source of religious knowledge that can be trusted without doubt. In the field of hadith studies, when a narrator is found to have lied—even if the lie was not in their specific narrations—all of their hadiths are classified as “matruk” or abandoned. Therefore, genAI chatbots like ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini, which have been proven to fabricate responses and generate false information, must be disregarded when it comes to religious matters.</p>
        <p>Now, let us now examine an example of a potential danger to the Muslim community. Although this scenario is fictional, it is entirely plausible within our society.</p>
        <p>X asks ChatGPT to generate a brief religious essay, which X then shares on social media, attributing it to himself as the author. Seeing the positive feedback, X becomes increasingly eager to produce more. One day, without realising it—due to never having verified the information or even knowing how to properly check it, as he has never studied religious matters—X unknowingly disseminates a fabricated hadith created by the chatbot, falsely attributing it to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.</p>
        <p>Let us now examine the mistakes made by X.</p> 
        <p>1. Plagiarism. In <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 6094, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: <b>“Lying leads to wickedness, and wickedness leads to the Hellfire.”</b></p>
        <p>2. The Prophet ﷺ said in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 5: <b>“It is sufficient for a person to be regarded as a liar if he narrates whatever he hears (without verifying it first.)”</b></p>
        <p>3. Ibn Taymiyyah (RH) in <i>Majmoo’ al-Fatawa</i> 10/449, stated: <b>“Whoever speaks about Islam without knowledge is a liar, even if they do not intend to lie.”</b></p>
        <p>4. In <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 107, the Messenger ﷺ said: <b>“Whoever tells a lie against me, let him occupy his seat in the Hellfire.”</b></p>
        <p>5. When a person who reads his essay practices the fabricated act, the Chosen One ﷺ said in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 1017: <b>“Whoever establishes an evil practice in Islam will have its burden and the burden of those who act upon it after him, without their burdens being diminished in any way.”</b></p>
        <p>Therefore, be cautious.</p>
