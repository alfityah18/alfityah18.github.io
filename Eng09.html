        <p>The knowledge that leads mankind to remember Allah and the Hereafter is being withdrawn—through the passing of great scholars and the isolation of those who are upon the straight path. How grave is ignorance when it becomes so widespread that it is no longer recognised as ignorance, but embraced as the norm. Without the light of religious knowledge, the human heart remains in darkness, even if the eyes behold a world full of colour.</p>
        <p>Rasulullah ﷺ continued his words by informing that widespread killing would occur. A heart engulfed in darkness brings nothing but disorder. It is no wonder, then, that with each passing day, we hear of yet more brutal acts of murder.</p>
