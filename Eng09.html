        <p>The knowledge that leads mankind to remember Allah and the Hereafter is being taken away—through the passing of great scholars and the isolation of those who are upon the straight path. How grave is ignorance when it becomes so widespread that it is no longer recognised as ignorance, but embraced as the norm. Without the light of religious knowledge, the human heart remains in darkness, even if the eyes behold a world full of colour.</p>
        <p>Rasulullah ﷺ went on to say that widespread killing would occur. A heart engulfed in darkness brings nothing but disorder. It is no wonder, then, that with each passing day, we hear of yet more brutal acts of murder.</p>
        <p>This is a sign that beneficial knowledge is being withdrawn—for it is no longer valued nor given due attention. Even among those who seek it, many are no longer diligent; they are sluggish, and if possible, would prefer each session to last no more than a minute. And knowledge has become a race to determine who can speak most cleverly, not who acts with sincerity. Indeed, knowledge has now become a matter of trade and transaction.</p>
        <p>Seize the opportunity while it is still available. Seek knowledge, not only to become a grateful servant, but for the sake of a secure future in the Hereafter. Do you not realise how exceedingly Merciful your Lord is? He not only offers knowledge freely, but also grants numerous virtues to those who pursue it. Let us now take a look at some of these noble virtues together.</p>
<h3>The Virtues of Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Through the narration of Abu Hurairah (RA) recorded in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2699, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ brought glad tidings that: whoever sets out on a path to seek knowledge, Allah will ease for him the path to Paradise. Those who gather in a house of Allah, to recite and study—especially the Quran—will be enveloped in spiritual tranquillity, covered in mercy, surrounded by angels, and most remarkably: Allah will mention them to the angels nearest to Him.</p>
