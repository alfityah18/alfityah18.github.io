        <p>The knowledge that leads mankind to remember Allah and the Hereafter is being taken away—through the passing of great scholars and the isolation of those who are upon the straight path. How grave is ignorance when it becomes so widespread that it is no longer recognised as ignorance, but embraced as the norm. Without the light of religious knowledge, the human heart remains in darkness, even if the eyes behold a world full of colour.</p>
        <p>Rasulullah ﷺ went on to say that widespread killing would occur. A heart engulfed in darkness brings nothing but disorder. It is no wonder, then, that with each passing day, we hear of yet more brutal acts of murder.</p>
        <p>This is a sign that beneficial knowledge is being withdrawn—for it is no longer valued nor given due attention. Even among those who seek it, many are no longer diligent; they are sluggish, and if possible, would prefer each session to last no more than a minute. And knowledge has become a race to determine who can speak most cleverly, not who acts with sincerity. Indeed, knowledge has now become a matter of trade and transaction.</p>
