        <p>The knowledge that leads mankind to remember Allah and the Hereafter is being taken away—through the passing of great scholars and the isolation of those who are upon the straight path. How grave is ignorance when it becomes so widespread that it is no longer recognised as ignorance, but embraced as the norm. Without the light of religious knowledge, the human heart remains in darkness, even if the eyes behold a world full of colour.</p>
        <p>Rasulullah ﷺ went on to say that widespread killing would occur. A heart engulfed in darkness brings nothing but disorder. It is no wonder, then, that with each passing day, we hear of yet more brutal acts of murder.</p>
        <p>This is a sign that beneficial knowledge is being withdrawn—for it is no longer valued nor given due attention. Even among those who seek it, many are no longer diligent; they are sluggish, and if possible, would prefer each session to last no more than a minute. And knowledge has become a race to determine who can speak most cleverly, not who acts with sincerity. Indeed, knowledge has now become a matter of trade and transaction.</p>
        <p>Seize the opportunity while it is still available. Seek knowledge, not only to become a grateful servant, but for the sake of a secure future in the Hereafter. Do you not realise how exceedingly Merciful your Lord is? He not only offers knowledge freely, but also grants numerous virtues to those who pursue it. Let us now take a look at some of these noble virtues together.</p>
<h3>The Virtues of Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Through the narration of Abu Hurairah (RA) recorded in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2699, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ brought glad tidings that whoever sets out on a path to seek knowledge, Allah will ease for him the path to Paradise. Those who gather in the house of Allah, to read and study the Quran with the aim of understanding and putting it into practice, will be enveloped in spiritual tranquillity, covered in mercy, surrounded by angels, and most remarkably—Allah will mention them to the angels nearest to Him.</p>
        <p>In <i>Sunan Ibn Majah</i> 226, which was authenticated by Sheikh Nasiruddin al-Albani (RH), the Messenger ﷺ said that whoever sets out in search of knowledge, the angels will lower their wings in approval of what he is doing. In <i>Sahih Ibn Hibban</i> 87, graded hasan by Sheikh Shu‘ayb al-Arnaut (RH), the Prophet ﷺ stated that a person who enters the mosque to teach or learn righteousness is like one striving in the path of Allah.</p>
        <p>Through the narration of Abu Darda (RA) in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2682, authenticated by Al-Albani (RH), the Chosen One ﷺ conveyed that the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, even the fish in the depths of the sea—seek forgiveness for the one who possesses knowledge. He further stated that the superiority of a person of knowledge over a worshipper is like the brilliance of the moon compared to the stars.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2685, graded hasan by Sheikh Zubayr Ali Zai (RH), the Prophet ﷺ described that Allah, the angels, the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, even the ant in its hole, and the fish—send blessings upon the one who teaches righteousness to mankind. In this version of the hadith, An-Nabi ﷺ remarked that the virtue of the knowledgeable over the worshipper is like his own rank compared to the lowest among the people.</p>
        <p>In <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 5027, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stated that the best among us are those who learn the sciences of the Quran—such as tajwid, tafsir, qira’at, and others—and then teach them to the people. And knowledge is incomplete without understanding. In <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 71, he ﷺ said:</p>
<h4>مَنْ يُرِدِ اللَّهُ بِهِ خَيْرًا يُفَقِّهْهُ فِي الدِّينْ</h4>       
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“If Allah intends good for someone, He grants him understanding in the religion.”</b></p>
        <p>This statement reminds us that understanding is a gift from Allah, not merely the result of effort. Deep comprehension in the religion is a sign that a person has been chosen by Allah to benefit the ummah. And the true mark of such understanding is its manifestation in one’s character. In <i>Musnad Ahmad</i> 9880, authenticated by Al-Arnaut (RH), the Prophet ﷺ informed that the best among the ummah are those with the best character—if they possess understanding in the religion.</p>
        <p>Knowledge is not meant to be kept. Through <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 3274, Rasulullah ﷺ instructed us to convey from him, even if it is just a single verse. In <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 2847, he informed that if someone is guided by Allah Ta’ala through the one who conveys knowledge—it is better for the knowledgeable than the most valuable of wealth. In fact, he ﷺ prayed that Allah brighten the face of the one who conveys his sayings and those of his Companions (RA), as recorded in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 3660, which was authenticated by Al-Albani (RH).</p>
        <p>The reward for those who convey knowledge is immense. Through the narration of Abu Hurairah (RA) recorded in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2674, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ explained that whoever calls others to guidance will receive a reward equal to that of those who follow it—without their reward being diminished in the slightest. Moreover, the reward for imparting beneficial knowledge continues even after the death of the knowledgeable person, as he ﷺ stated in a well-known hadith found in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 1631.</p>
        <p>Now, with all these remarkable virtues, what pure heart would not be drawn to it? If you have read this far, it may well be that Allah (AWJ) is opening your heart to knowledge. So, turn to Him in supplication, just as our Prophet ﷺ taught us in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 3599, deemed hasan by Imam Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalani (RH) in <i>Bulugh ul-Maram</i> 457:</p>
<h4>اللَّهُمَّ انْفَعْنِي بِمَا عَلَّمْتَنِي وَعَلِّمْنِي مَا يَنْفَعُنِي وَزِدْنِي عِلْمًا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ عَلَى كُلِّ حَالٍ وَأَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ مِنْ حَالِ أَهْلِ النَّارِ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“O Allah, benefit me with what You have taught me, teach me what will benefit me, and increase me in knowledge. All praise is due to Allah in every circumstance, and I seek refuge in Allah from the condition of the people of the Fire.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>In conclusion, seek knowledge to truly know your Lord, your Prophet, and this religion of Islam—rooted in evidence from the Quran and the Sunnah—under the guidance of teachers who follow the path of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his noble Companions (RA). Then, act upon it. Call others to it. And remain patient through every trial along this journey of knowledge—a journey most noble.</p>
