<h3>The Complete Hadith</h3>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Rib’i ibn Hirash (RH) narrated that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman (RA) said:</p>
<h4>يَدْرُسُ الْإِسْلَامُ كَمَا يَدْرُسُ وَشْيُ الثَّوْبِ لَا يُدْرَى مَا صِيَامٌ وَلَا صَدَقَةٌ وَلَا نُسُكٌ وَيُسْرَى عَلَى كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فِي لَيْلَةٍ فَلَا يَبْقَى فِي الْأَرْضِ مِنْهُ آيَةٌ وَيَبْقَى طَوَائِفُ مِنَ النَّاسِ الشَّيْخُ الْكَبِيرُ وَالْعَجُوزُ الْكَبِيرَةُ يَقُولُونَ أَدْرَكْنَا آبَاءَنَا عَلَى هَذِهِ الْكَلِمَةِ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ فَنَحْنُ نَقُولُهَا فَقَالَ صِلَةُ فَمَا تُغْنِي عَنْهُمْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ لَا يَدْرُونَ مَا صِيَامٌ وَلَا صَدَقَةٌ وَلَا نُسُكٌ؟ فَأَعْرَضَ عَنْهُ حُذَيْفَةُ فَرَدَّدَ عَلَيْهِ ثَلَاثًا كُلُّ ذَلِكَ يُعْرِضُ عَنْهُ ثُمَّ أَقْبَلَ عَلَيْهِ فِي الثَّالِثَةِ فَقَالَ يَا صِلَةُ تُنْجِيهِمْ مِنَ النَّارِ تُنْجِيهِمْ مِنَ النَّارِ تُنْجِيهِمْ مِنَ النَّارِ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Islam will wear away just as the embroidery on a garment fades—until what fasting, charity, and pilgrimage rites are is no longer recognised. And the Book of Allah will be lifted in one night, and not a single Verse from it will remain on earth. And there will be a small portion of the people left—the elderly men and the elderly women—who will say: ‘We saw our forefathers say these words: “There is no god but Allah,” so we say them too.’”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Silah said:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“What benefit will ‘There is no god but Allah’ be to them when they do not know what fasting is, nor charity, nor pilgrimage rites?”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Hudhayfah turned away from him, but he repeated it to him three times, and each time Hudhayfah turned away. Then on the third time, he turned to him and said:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“O Silah, it will save them from the Fire, it will save them from the Fire, it will save them from the Fire.”</b></p>
        
<h3>Hadith Explanation</h3>
        <p>Islam reduced to a mere name. Muslims who do not recognise fasting, charity, or the pilgrimage rites—whether in their rightful observance or in the spirit of the worship itself—have long been among us. Yet this hadith specifically speaks of a time very near to the Final Hour, not our present age. In truth, Islam is indeed being increasingly worn away. This is based on the words of Anas ibn Malik (RA) in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7068:</p>
<h4>اصْبِرُوا، فَإِنَّهُ لاَ يَأْتِي عَلَيْكُمْ زَمَانٌ إِلاَّ الَّذِي بَعْدَهُ شَرٌّ مِنْهُ، حَتَّى تَلْقَوْا رَبَّكُمْ.‏ سَمِعْتُهُ مِنْ نَبِيِّكُمْ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ.‏</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Be patient, for there will never come upon you a time except that what follows it will be worse than what came before, until you meet your Lord. I heard this from your Prophet ﷺ.”</b></p>
        <p>The wearing away of Islam does not refer to the religion itself—as brought by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and preserved by the Righteous Predecessors, with its purity never altered—but rather to its understanding and practice among its adherents. This accords with the Prophet’s words in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 145, which state that Islam began as something strange and will once again return to strangeness. Only one path endures, while those that have worn away have already divided into seventy-two. Nevertheless, its pinnacle will be witnessed anew in the era of Al-Mahdi and Prophet Jesus (AS), before this hadith under discussion becomes a reality.</p>
        <p>Some of us are already aware of how the lives of the final believers and Muslims on earth will be taken. After the occurrence of several major signs, such as the greatest deception of the Antichrist and the havoc of Gog and Magog, humanity will experience a period of peace and security under Prophet Jesus (AS) for a time. Then, in a lengthy hadith recorded in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2937, An-Nawwas ibn Sam‘an (RA) narrated that Rasulullah ﷺ said, towards the end of that hadith:</p>
<h4>بَعَثَ اللَّهُ رِيحًا طَيِّبَةً فَتَأْخُذُهُمْ تَحْتَ آبَاطِهِمْ فَتَقْبِضُ رُوحَ كُلِّ مُؤْمِنٍ وَكُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Allah will send a pleasant wind, which will pass beneath the armpits of every believer and every Muslim, then it will seize their souls.”</b></p>
        <p>The question, then, is how are we to understand the hadith under discussion in relation to <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2937? If all the believers and Muslims have already passed away, how can the events described in <i>Al-Mustadrak</i> 8636 take place? Or when, in fact, do they occur? To arrive at a clearer narrative, we must add yet another hadith and consider the three together. Through <i>Al-Mu’jam al-Kabir</i> 8698, in which the chain of narration was graded authentic by Imam Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalani (RH), ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (RA) said:</p>
<h4>لَيُنْتَزَعَنَّ هَذَا الْقُرْآنُ مِنْ بَيْنِ أَظْهُرِكُمْ، قِيلَ لَهُ: يَا أَبَا عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ، كَيْفَ يُنْتَزَعُ وَقَدْ أَثْبَتْنَاهُ فِي قُلُوبِنَا وَأَثْبَتْنَاهُ فِي مُصَاحِفِنَا؟ قَالَ يُسْرَى عَلَيْهِ فِي لَيْلَةٍ فَلَا يَبْقَى فِي قَلْبِ عَبْدٍ وَلَا مُصْحَفٍ مِنْهُ شَيْءٌ، وَيُصْبِحُ النَّاسُ كَالْبَهَائِمِ. ثُمَّ قَرَأَ قَوْلَ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى ﴿وَلَئِن شِئْنَا لَنَذْهَبَنَّ بِالَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُ لَكَ بِهِ عَلَيْنَا وَكِيلًا﴾ [الإسراء: 86]</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“This Quran will indeed be taken away from your midst.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">He was asked:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“O Abu ‘Abdur-Rahman, how will it be taken away when we have committed it to memory and inscribed it in our manuscripts?”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">He replied:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“It will be lifted in the course of a single night, leaving neither trace in the heart of any soul nor in any manuscript. By morning, the people will awaken as if bereft of reason, like grazing cattle.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Then he recited the Words of Allah, Exalted is He (Al-Isra 17:86):</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“And if We willed, We could surely take away that which We have revealed to you—then you would find no protector for it against Us.”</b></p>
        <p>Now, let us reconstruct the sequence of events as it appears most accurate, ٱللّٰهُ أَعْلَمُ. When Allah sends forth that pleasant wind, only the believers and those who have truly lived by Islam will pass away. As indicated in <i>Al-Mustadrak</i> 8636, those who carry the testimony of faith within their hearts but have not lived in accordance with Islam, will not be taken away with Prophet Jesus (AS). They will remain as the final generation still upholding Tawhid before humanity ceases to acknowledge the Oneness of Allah.</p>
        <p>Once they are gone, only then will the Quran be lifted away from every human heart and erased from every copy, whether in print or digital form—if such technology still exists at that time. It will be lifted in a single night, across the entire world. So, from whom will the Quran be taken? From those who outwardly appear as Muslims, yet in reality their shahadah has long since been nullified, or never truly existed within their hearts. These are the people whose hearts are filled with major disbelief, major shirk, and major hypocrisy. Alongside the disbelievers, they will live like cattle, and witness with their very own eyes the horrors of the Hour descending upon them.</p>
        <p>This sequence is understood by reading Hudhayfah’s (RA) words in the primary hadith as a thematic presentation rather than a strict chronology. It is highly plausible that he placed the shahadah at the conclusion of his statement for rhetorical effect, to underscore its utmost importance, rather than to define an order of events. This removes any apparent contradiction between the three hadith when they are considered together.</p>
        <p>The most important lesson to emerge from this discussion is, however, the immeasurable weight and sanctity of the shahadah. In the hadith narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (RA), recorded in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2639 and graded authentic by Darussalam, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p>
<h4>إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَيُخَلِّصُ رَجُلاً مِنْ أُمَّتِي عَلَى رُءُوسِ الْخَلاَئِقِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَيَنْشُرُ عَلَيْهِ تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ سِجِلاًّ كُلُّ سِجِلٍّ مِثْلُ مَدِّ الْبَصَرِ ثُمَّ يَقُولُ أَتُنْكِرُ مِنْ هَذَا شَيْئًا أَظَلَمَكَ كَتَبَتِي الْحَافِظُونَ فَيَقُولُ لاَ يَا رَبِّ.‏ فَيَقُولُ أَفَلَكَ عُذْرٌ فَيَقُولُ لاَ يَا رَبِّ.‏ فَيَقُولُ بَلَى إِنَّ لَكَ عِنْدَنَا حَسَنَةً فَإِنَّهُ لاَ ظُلْمَ عَلَيْكَ الْيَوْمَ فَتَخْرُجُ بِطَاقَةٌ فِيهَا أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ فَيَقُولُ احْضُرْ وَزْنَكَ فَيَقُولُ يَا رَبِّ مَا هَذِهِ الْبِطَاقَةُ مَعَ هَذِهِ السِّجِلاَّتِ فَقَالَ إِنَّكَ لاَ تُظْلَمُ.‏ قَالَ فَتُوضَعُ السِّجِلاَّتُ فِي كِفَّةٍ وَالْبِطَاقَةُ فِي كِفَّةٍ فَطَاشَتِ السِّجِلاَّتُ وَثَقُلَتِ الْبِطَاقَةُ فَلاَ يَثْقُلُ مَعَ اسْمِ اللَّهِ شَيْءٌ.‏</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Indeed, Allah will single out a man from my ummah before all of creation on the Day of Judgement. Ninety-nine scrolls will be laid out for him, each scroll stretching as far as the eye can see. Then He will say:</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘Do you deny any of this? Did My recording angels wrong you?’</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>He will answer:</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘No, O Lord.’</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Allah will say:</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘Do you have any excuse?’</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>He will reply:</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘No, O Lord.’</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Allah will say:</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘However, you have one good deed with Us, and you will not be wronged today.’</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Then a card will be brought forth; on it is written: ‘I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.’ He will say:</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘Bring forth your scales.’</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>He will ask:</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘O Lord, what is this card compared to these scrolls?’</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Allah will say:</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>‘You will not be wronged.’</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>The scrolls will then be placed on one side of the scale, and the card on the other; the scrolls will become light, and the card will be heavy—for nothing outweighs the Name of Allah.”</b></p>
        <p>It should be known the declaration was truly understood and lived out in his life—not merely uttered as words. The ninety-nine scrolls, on the other hand, represent sins that do not include the nullifiers of the shahadah which remove a person from the fold of Islam. Sadly, there are some among the ummah today who remain unaware or indifferent to the existence of such sins.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, if those who neglect the practice of Islam attempt to equate themselves with the elderly mentioned in Hudhayfah’s (RA) hadith, the answer is: they are not the same. This is because, at that time, there will no longer remain any example or reference for acts of worship; whereas in our age, knowledge is widespread and readily accessible. All forms of negligence, therefore, will be held accountable.</p>

<h3>The Meaning of the Shahadah</h3>
<h4>أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱللَّٰهِ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.</b></p>
        <p>The Shahadah is a testimony given—for the purpose of complete submission to the will of Allah—by acknowledging that nothing whatsoever has the right to be worshipped except Allah alone, without any partner; and that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is His servant and His Messenger. It is not merely a verbal utterance, but a covenant, a sacred pledge, and a binding commitment—one that entails accountability before Allah the Exalted. And it must be undertaken with:</p>
        <p>(1) <b>Knowledge</b>: Gaining a deep and correct understanding of Allah, His Messenger, and the religion of Islam through the Quran and Sunnah—so as to truly comprehend Tawhid, reject all kinds of polytheism, follow the guidance of the Sunnah, and avoid all forms of innovation in religious practice. In <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 26, ‘Uthman (RA) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>
<h4>مَنْ مَاتَ وَهُوَ يَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Whoever dies knowing (fully well) that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah—will enter Paradise.”</b></p> 
        <p>(2) <b>Certainty</b>: The testimony must be borne without any doubt. In <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 27, through the narration of Abu Hurayrah (RA), The Chosen One ﷺ affirmed that no servant meets Allah with these two statements—without any doubt concerning them—except that he will enter Paradise. And in Surah al-Hujurat, Verse 15, Allah (AWJ) says:</p>
<h4>إِنَّمَا ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِۦ ثُمَّ لَمۡ يَرۡتَابُواْ وَجَٰهَدُواْ بِأَمۡوَٰلِهِمۡ وَأَنفُسِهِمۡ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِۚ أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلصَّٰدِقُونَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>The true believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, then they do not harbour any doubt, and they strive with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah. It is they who are truthful (in their claim of faith).</b></p>
        <p>(3) <b>Sincerity</b>: The testimony and all acts of worship must be performed with the intention of seeking Allah’s pleasure alone. Verse 14 of Surah az-Zumar commands us to worship Allah by dedicating all acts of devotion to Him—that is, without committing major shirk, such as believing that a saint can be invoked for supplication, or minor shirk, such as showing off. In <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 5401, Rasulullah ﷺ said:</p>
<h4>فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ حَرَّمَ عَلَى النَّارِ مَنْ قَالَ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ‏ يَبْتَغِي بِذَلِكَ وَجْهَ اللَّهِ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Indeed, Allah has forbidden the Fire for whoever says, ‘There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah,’ seeking thereby the pleasure of Allah.”</b></p> 
        <p>(4) <b>Truthfulness</b>: A testimony that is false or insincere nullifies the Shahadah. The hypocrites of the Prophet’s ﷺ time also recited these two statements, yet they were described as deserving the deepest part of Hell. In Verse 11 of Surah al-Fath, Allah (SWT) reveals:</p>
<h4>يَقُولُونَ بِأَلۡسِنَتِهِم مَّا لَيۡسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمۡۚ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts.</b></p>
        <p>The Shahadah must be upheld by Al-Qalb us-Salim mentioned in Verse 89 of Surah ash-Shu’ara—that is, the sound heart, purified and free from shirk and hypocrisy.</p>
        <p>(5) <b>Love</b>: The Shahadah must be accompanied by love for Allah and His Messenger above all else. This means that a person must never elevate anything or anyone to a rank equal to, or comparable with, that of God; just as the Christians elevated Prophet Jesus (AS) as the son of God, or as the Rafidhah deify ‘Ali (RA), or as certain Sufi groups love their leaders to a degree equal to that of loving God. In Verse 165 of Surah al-Baqarah, Allah, Jalla Jalaluhu, says:</p>
<h4>وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَندَادࣰا يُحِبُّونَهُمۡ كَحُبِّ ٱللَّهِۖ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓاْ أَشَدُّ حُبࣰّا لِّلَّهِۗ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>And among mankind are those who take others besides Allah as equals to Him; they love them as they should love Allah. But those who believe are stronger in their love for Allah.</b></p>
        <p>(6) <b>Obedience</b>: The Shahadah must be accompanied by obedience to the commands of Allah and His Messenger, and by avoidance of all that He has forbidden. A true believer does not follow the inclinations of his own desires or the preferences of others, but rather the will of the All-Powerful, the All-Wise, and the guidance of His Prophet. In Verse 36 of Surah al-Ahzab, our Lord says:</p>
<h4>وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤۡمِنࣲ وَلَا مُؤۡمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥٓ أَمۡرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ ٱلۡخِيَرَةُ مِنۡ أَمۡرِهِمۡۗ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>It is not for a believing man or woman—when Allah and His Messenger decree a matter—to have any other choice in that matter.</b></p>
        <p>(7) <b>Acceptance</b>: And the Shahadah must be received with full willingness and humility. Not all who acknowledge the truth of these two statements truly accept them. For example, the People of the Book in Madinah recognized the truth of the Prophethood of Muhammad ﷺ, yet they rejected him due to arrogance and their unwillingness to abandon inherited traditions. In Verse 35 of Surah as-Saffat, Allah says:</p>
<h4>إِنَّهُمۡ كَانُوٓاْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمۡ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ يَسۡتَكۡبِرُونَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>For whenever it was said to them, “There is no god worthy of worship except Allah,” they acted arrogantly.</b></p> 
        <p>The Shahadah is not only uttered at the moment a person embraces Islam; rather, it forms the foundation of one’s way of life and is a practice that continues throughout the life of a Muslim, especially within his or her daily prayers. Indeed, a person ought to depart from this world in a state of living by it. And the Shahadah is the key to the gates of Paradise. Therefore, let us together reflect more deeply upon both components of the Shahadah.</p>

<h3>أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ</h3>
        <p>To acknowledge that nothing whatsoever has the right to be worshipped except Allah means that you do not merely acknowledge that Allah is the One and Only God—the Most Perfect, upon whom all creation depends; who neither begets nor is begotten; and to whom nothing is equal, comparable, or similar; who created all worlds, who possesses dominion over the heavens and the earth, who continually governs His creation, and who gives life and causes death; and who possesses the Most Beautiful Names and Attributes—but that you also affirm that He alone is truly deserving of worship. By doing so, you affirm the truth of related Quranic Verses and hadiths, such as Allah’s statement in Verse 102 of Surah al-An‘am:</p>
<h4>ذَٰلِكُمُ ٱللَّهُ رَبُّكُمۡۖ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَۖ خَٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَيۡءࣲ فَٱعۡبُدُوهُۚ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءࣲ وَكِيلࣱ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>That is Allah—your Lord! There is no god worthy of worship except Him. He is the Creator of all things, so worship Him alone. And He is the Maintainer of everything.</b></p>
        <p>By this, you are bound not to associate anything with Allah in worship and devotion to Him; namely: not to love anything or anyone equally with or above Allah; not to invoke or supplicate to other than Allah; not to intend righteous deeds for other than Allah; not to obey anyone who declares lawful what Allah has made unlawful, or unlawful what Allah has made lawful; and many other forms of shirk, whether major or minor. By this also, you understand that major shirk nullifies one’s Islam, is not forgiven by Allah if one dies upon it, and results in eternal residence in the Fire. By doing so, you affirm the truth of related Quranic Verses and hadiths, such as Allah’s statement in Verse 48 of Surah an-Nisa:</p>
<h4>إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغۡفِرُ أَن يُشۡرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغۡفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُۚ وَمَن يُشۡرِكۡ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفۡتَرَىٰٓ إِثۡمًا عَظِيمًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating others with Him, but forgives anything else of whoever He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah has indeed committed a grave sin.</b></p>    

<h3>وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱللَّٰهِ</h3>
        <p>To acknowledge Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah al-Qurashi al-Hashimi ﷺ as the Messenger of Allah means that you consent to accept him as a Messenger, a Prophet, and a servant of Allah; whereby you categorically deny that he possesses a status equal to God, any authority to govern the affairs of creation, any right to be worshipped, or any independent power to bring benefit or harm to himself or to others. By doing so, you affirm the truth of related Quranic Verses and hadiths, such as Allah’s statement in Verse 50 of Surah al-An‘am:</p>
<h4>قُل لَّآ أَقُولُ لَكُمۡ عِندِي خَزَآئِنُ ٱللَّهِ وَلَآ أَعۡلَمُ ٱلۡغَيۡبَ وَلَآ أَقُولُ لَكُمۡ إِنِّي مَلَكٌۖ إِنۡ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَيَّۚ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Say (Muhammad), “I do not say to you that the treasures of Allah are with me, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I only follow what has been revealed to me.”</b></p> 
        <p>You also agree to believe in everything conveyed by him, to obey all of his commands, and to refrain from all that he forbade. You further commit to worshipping Allah only in the manner taught, demonstrated, and prescribed by him. By this, you understand that obedience to him constitutes obedience to Allah, and that rejection of him amounts to rejection of Allah. In doing so, you affirm the truth of related Quranic Verses and hadiths, such as Allah’s statement in Verse 158 of Surah al-A’raf:</p>
<h4>قُلۡ يَآأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ إِلَيۡكُمۡ جَمِيعًا ٱلَّذِي لَهُۥ مُلۡكُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ لَآ إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحۡيِۦ وَيُمِيتُۖ فَآمِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ٱلنَّبِيِّ ٱلۡأُمِّيِّ ٱلَّذِي يُؤۡمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَكَلِمَٰتِهِۦ وَٱتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمۡ تَهۡتَدُونَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Say (Muhammad), “O mankind! Indeed, I am the Messenger of Allah to you all. He alone owns the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is nothing worthy of worship except Him. He is the One who gives life and causes death.” So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah and His words. And follow him, so that you may be guided.</b></p> 

<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>The Shahadah is not sufficient as a mere utterance; it must be held firmly in the heart and reflected through one’s actions. If it is not preserved, the Shahadah can, in fact, be nullified, rendering a person no longer a Muslim. God willing, we will explore this topic in more detail in the near future. Stay tuned.</p>
