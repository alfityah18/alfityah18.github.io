        <p>The three signs foretold by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ have long since been unfolding. Yet not everyone perceives them. This is because they emerge as Islam fades—when ignorance and sin have already veiled the sight of the heart, like a night cloaked in darkness. Many can no longer distinguish between right and wrong. In <i>Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah</i> 37569, when asked about the most severe form of fitna, Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman (RA) explained that:</p>
<h4>أَنْ يُعْرَضَ عَلَيْكَ الْخَيْرُ وَالشَّرُّ لَا تَدْرِي أَيَّهُمَا تَتْبَعُ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“It is when both good and evil are laid before you, but you are unsure which path to follow.”</b></p> 
        <p>A heart that pays no heed to the Words of Allah and the sayings of His Messenger will see the wicked only as the godless see them—murderers, robbers, the corrupt, and the like. Thus, when such a person follows those who champion Western ideologies and reject the laws of Islam, or glorifies a religious leader who calls people to supplicate to others besides Allah, or admires a preacher who tarnishes the Sunnah of Rasulullah ﷺ with deviant thoughts and innovated practices—he remains completely unaware that these are, in fact, far more wicked, according to the definitions set by Allah and His Messenger.</p>
