        <p>The three signs foretold by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ have long since been unfolding. Yet not everyone perceives them. This is because they emerge as Islam fades—when ignorance and sin have already veiled the sight of the heart, like a night cloaked in darkness. Many can no longer distinguish between right and wrong. In <i>Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah</i> 37569, when asked about the most severe form of fitna, Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman (RA) explained that:</p>
<h4>أَنْ يُعْرَضَ عَلَيْكَ الْخَيْرُ وَالشَّرُّ لَا تَدْرِي أَيَّهُمَا تَتْبَعُ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“It is when both good and evil are laid before you, but you are unsure which path to follow.”</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>A heart that pays no heed to the Words of Allah and the sayings of His Messenger will see the wicked only as the godless see them—murderers, robbers, the corrupt, and the like. Thus, when such a person follows those who champion Western ideologies and reject the laws of Islam, or glorifies a religious leader who calls people to supplicate to others besides Allah, or admires a preacher who tarnishes the Sunnah of Rasulullah ﷺ with deviant thoughts and innovated practices—he remains completely unaware that these are, in fact, far more wicked, according to the definitions set by Allah and His Messenger.</p>
        <p>How can a person who belittles the worth of faith, as described in Verse 13 of Surah al-Baqarah, be hailed as wise, whilst one who truly believes is dismissed as backward? How can someone who defies his Lord’s command in Verse 14 of Surah ar-Ra’d to pray to Allah alone, be deemed righteous, while the one who calls people to worship Him exclusively is branded wicked? And how can a person who introduces innovations into a religion already perfected, as affirmed in Verse 3 of Surah al-Maidah, be regarded as a bringer of harmony, while the one who safeguards the purity of the Messenger’s teachings is condemned as a cause of division?</p>
        <p>The hadith we are discussing shows that these inverted perceptions arise from prioritising guidance other than the Quran. The pre-Islamic Arabs believed they followed the religion of Prophet Abraham (AS), yet it had already been corrupted. When Prophet Muhammad ﷺ—whose honesty was universally acknowledged—came with revelation, they still rejected it. Intellect, desire, influence, popular opinion, social conventions, culture, and ancestral tradition had clouded their hearts. None of these determine right and wrong; only revelation does. In Verse 1 of Surah al-Furqan, Allah, Exalted is He, says:</p>
<h4>تَبَارَكَ ٱلَّذِي نَزَّلَ ٱلۡفُرۡقَانَ عَلَىٰ عَبۡدِهِۦ لِيَكُونَ لِلۡعَٰلَمِينَ نَذِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Blessed is the One Who sent down the Standard (to distinguish between right and wrong) to His servant (Muhammad), so that he may be a warner to the worlds.</b></p> 
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>A heart that neither understands nor reflects upon the Verses of Allah and the sayings of His Messenger cannot separate the wheat from the chaff—even when the difference is plainly visible. He beautifies his voice as he recites to you the Verses of Tawhid, yet he is the very one who champions acts of shirk, innovation, and superstition. He presents a calm demeanour while reading the Verses of patience, yet he is the first to lash out with harsh words when his knowledge is challenged. His eyes well up with tears as he recites the Verses on spending in the way of Allah, yet he is the same person who uses your donations to indulge in luxury.</p>

<h4>كَيْفَ أَنْتُمْ إِذَا لَبِسَتْكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ يَهْرَمُ فِيهَا الْكَبِيرُ وَيَرْبُو فِيهَا الصَّغِيرُ، وَيَتَّخِذُهَا النَّاسُ سُنَّةً، فَإِذَا غُيِّرَتْ، قَالُوا غُيِّرَتْ السُّنَّةُ، قَالُوا وَمَتَى ذَلِكَ يَا أَبَا عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ؟ قَالَ إِذَا كَثُرَتْ قُرَّاؤُكُمْ، وَقَلَّتْ فُقَهَاؤُكُمْ، وَكَثُرَتْ أُمَرَاؤُكُمْ، وَقَلَّتْ أُمَنَاؤُكُمْ، وَالْتُمِسَتِ الدُّنْيَا بِعَمَلِ الْآخِرَةِ</h4>
