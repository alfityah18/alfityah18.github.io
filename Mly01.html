        <p>Hadith ini* sangat istimewa. Ia mengisahkan Jibril (AS) datang menemui Nabi Muhammad ﷺ untuk mengajarkan kepada kita butiran paling dasar cara-cara hidup beragama: bagaimana menjadi seorang <b>Muslim</b>, <b>Mukmin</b>, atau mencapai maqam yang tertinggi, <b>Muhsin</b>. Di mana semua itu tidak lengkap tanpa mengambil kira akan kepentingan <b>ilmu fitan</b>. Dan Allah (SWT) menempatkan dua tanda As-Sa’ah yang sangat signifikan dengan zaman kita, di dalam hadith yang sangat mustahak ini. Adakah ia tanda Kiamat sudah pun dekat? Sudah semestinya. Atau juga menandakan fasa tanda-tanda kecil sudah pun menghampiri penghujungnya? <b>الله أعلم</b>.</p>
         <p class="small-text">*Hadith penuhnya lebih panjang; sila lihat di dalam <i>Sahih Muslim</i>.</p>
<h3>Tanda Menjadi Nyata</h3>
         <p>Bermula pada tahun 1966, eksperimen gabungan teknik perubatan Patrick Steptoe, seorang <i>gynecologist</i> dan Sir Robert Edwards, seorang <i>embryologist</i> dari Britain telah berjaya menghasilkan teknologi <b>in vitro fertilisation (IVF)</b>. Pencapaian sulung mereka telah menggemparkan dunia apabila Louise Brown, bayi tabung uji yang pertama lahir pada <b>25 Julai, 1978</b>. Kejayaan itu malah merintis prosedur yang lebih kontroversi di mana pada <b>1 Ogos, 1985</b>, Shannon Boff, seorang suri rumah dari Amerika Syarikat telah menjadi <i>ibu tumpang</i> pertama yang menerima bayaran bagi mengandungkan sperma dan telur pasangan yang lain, yang dengan secara literalnya menjadikan dia <b>hamba</b> yang melahirkan <b>puan</b> atau <b>tuannya</b>.</p>
         <p>In <i>Musnad Ahmad</i> 2926, it is written that the Prophet ﷺ explained that the goat herders referred to the Arab people. In 1932, the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia demanded novel sources of revenue beyond the customary Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. Then, in 1938, the Dammam No. 7 oil well transformed the <b>once-destitute dry peninsula</b> into the world's largest petroleum source, triggering an architectural race for grandeur. With newfound wealth came the pursuit of taller and even more elaborate buildings, and the <b>Dubai World Trade Centre</b> claimed the distinction of being the first skyscraper in the Middle East upon its unveiling on <b>February 26, 1979</b>. And the race for architectural supremacy continues to this day.<p/>
         <p>The two signs mentioned in the Hadith of Gabriel <b>have been occurring together for the past 45 years</b>, considering the year IVF technology succeeded and the construction of the tallest building in the Arabia at that time. Science and technology have long been beneficial to us, humanity – from ancient times to the present day. However, the two signs in the hadith serve as a warning to be cautious of their fitna: <b>science's ability to change human nature, and technology's tendency to make people more engrossed in worldly pleasures</b>.</p>
         <p>While identifying the fitna present in science and technology, such as IVF, is somewhat straightforward, the rapid and pervasive advancements that have become an integral part of our way of life can effortlessly make us complacent. Without many realizing it, the presence of <b>artificial intelligence (AI)</b> including <b>computers</b> and <b>smartphones</b>, has subtly altered human nature, causing individuals to become progressively mesmerized with worldly desires. In effect, it has become a <b>predator</b> that preys on the weak souls. As stated by Muhammad The Chosen One ﷺ in <i>Jami' at-Tirmidhi</i> 2181:</p>
<h4>لاَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى تُكَلِّمَ السِّبَاعُ الإِنْسَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“As-Sa’ah tidak akan berlaku sebelum ‘makhluk pemangsa’ bercakap-cakap dengan manusia.”</b></p>
<p>Many have fallen victim to its powerful grasp – spending excessive amounts of time under its captivity;  familial ties wane as virtual relationships gain traction; social skills wither, and health issues abound, especially among children; opportunities to indulge in sinful acts are at one's fingertips; even new predators like ChatGPT have claimed some job opportunities. But Islam is not a stagnant way of life in the passage of time. The predator is like a mighty lion, with <b>strength</b> and <b>wisdom</b>, it can be conquered, tamed, and its benefits reaped.</p>
<h3>Pemisahan Dunia & Akhirat</h3>
         <p>Verse 7 of Surah ar-Rum and <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2722 categorizes knowledge into 2 types: beneficial, specifically the divine knowledge encompassing the Quran and Sunnah, along with knowledge interconnected or aligned with their principles; and the other type lacks such connections or any correlation whatsoever. Therefore, controversies around certain areas of science and technology emerge due to ideas that have nothing to do with divine guidance and innovations that are disengaged from its messages. These creations were originally intended merely for worldly benefit, with no consideration for spiritual gain. This problem dates back to the <b>500 years of European colonialism</b>. In <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 4297, our beloved Rasulullah ﷺ said:</p>
<h4>يُوشِكُ الأُمَمُ أَنْ تَدَاعَى عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَا تَدَاعَى الأَكَلَةُ إِلَى قَصْعَتِهَا.‏ فَقَالَ قَائِلٌ وَمِنْ قِلَّةٍ نَحْنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ قَالَ بَلْ أَنْتُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ كَثِيرٌ وَلَكِنَّكُمْ غُثَاءٌ كَغُثَاءِ السَّيْلِ وَلَيَنْزِعَنَّ اللَّهُ مِنْ صُدُورِ عَدُوِّكُمُ الْمَهَابَةَ مِنْكُمْ وَلَيَقْذِفَنَّ اللَّهُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمُ الْوَهَنَ.‏ فَقَالَ قَائِلٌ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَمَا الْوَهَنُ قَالَ حُبُّ الدُّنْيَا وَكَرَاهِيَةُ الْمَوْتِ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Tidak lama lagi, bangsa-bangsa asing akan berkumpul sesama mereka untuk merebutkan kalian, sepertimana para penjamu selera berkumpul untuk merebutkan hidangan-hidangan yang mewah.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Seseorang bertanya:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b><i>“Adakah itu akan berlaku kerana jumlah kita pada waktu itu sedikit?”</i></b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Baginda menjawab:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>"“Tidak, malah jumlah kalian pada waktu itu sangatlah banyak. Namun, keadaan kalian hanyalah seperti lapisan buih yang membawa sampah sarap yang dihanyutkan banjir. Sesungguhnya, Allah akan mencabut ketakutan daripada dada musuh kalian dan Allah akan menanamkan ke dalam hati kalian dengan al-wahn.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Baginda ditanya:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b><i>“Ya Rasulullah, apakah itu al-wahn?”</i></b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Baginda membalas:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Cinta kepada dunia dan benci kepada kematian.”</b></p>
         <p>Although the term <strong>"secularism"</strong> may have been coined by 19th-century British reformist, George Jacob Holyoake, its consequences were warned of over 1,400 years ago by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. The roots of this concept can be traced back to historical events such as the French Revolution, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Thirty Years' War. And the story of the people of Midian, recorded in Verse 87 of Surah Hud, also illustrates this principle: charged with economic oppression, they mockingly questioned the role of religion in commercial affairs. From these historical and religious contexts, and what it has done to the world today, we've witnessed the development and the unfortunate consequences of the principle of <strong>separating religion from worldly matters</strong>.</p>
<h3>Perangkap & Kerugian Umat</h3>
         <p>Colonialism not only confiscated wealth but also imposed its own long-term framework on our thoughts. Secularism has been proven to perpetuate the same issue as in Verse 87 of Surah Hud: economic oppression from capitalism, while also promoting its patriarch: a libertine lifestyle, known as liberalism, that endorses other tenets such as pluralism. Consequently, a generation enamored with the temporal realm has been born, overlooking the spiritual importancy. This has been planted through the greatest deception: <b>their education system</b> – a factory that has produced Muslims who, despite inheriting and succeeding, inadvertently propagate the echoes of their former oppressors.</p>
         <p>While actively pursuing worldly knowledge, the vast majority of this group has not fully appreciated the implications of adopting Western paradigms of thought, lifestyle, and conduct. Despite the inclusion of religious teachings, they are usually presented as peripheral and lacking the necessary depth to make an indelible impact. This is reflected in the fact that many alumni of this educational system or its equivalent have become non-observant Muslims. However, is it sufficient for only a small group to seek divine knowledge for the progress of Islam? Let us reflect on the words of Rasulullah ﷺ in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2526:</p>
<h4>تَجِدُونَ النَّاسَ مَعَادِنَ فَخِيَارُهُمْ فِي الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ خِيَارُهُمْ فِي الإِسْلاَمِ إِذَا فَقُهُوا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Engkau akan mendapati manusia itu seperti MINERAL. Yang terbaik di kalangan kalian saat jahiliyah, dialah juga yang akan menjadi yang terbaik di kalangan kalian setelah Islam, itu pun jika dia dikurniakan kefahaman dalam agama.”</b></p>
         <p>Human beings are akin to minerals. Just as gold retains its value even when used in worldly pursuits; lead, despite being elevated to the sphere of religious affairs, cannot become gold due to its innate, inherent and different nature and value. Similarly, individuals born with low IQs or without natural leadership abilities can’t become geniuses or great leaders, no matter how much they strive to do so. As a result, when the vast majority are focused on pursuing worldly knowledge, the high-quality minerals that remain for the acquisition of divine knowledge inevitably dwindle.</p>
         <p>The segregation has produced intellectuals who specialize only in worldly or religious knowledge, but not both, as was common in the early generations and their successors. This represents a great loss, as we have failed to produce individuals of "platinum" caliber, such as 'Umar (RA), who served as the "president" of the state, and was also a scholar, jurist, and mufti. Similarly, there are a handful "diamonds" like Ibn Khaldun (RH), who excelled in numerous fields such as history, sociology, astronomy, and chemistry. Unfortunately, the European education system, or its influence, has rendered us weak and subservient to their deviant principles.</p>
<h3>Kembali Kepada Nubuwwah</h3>
         <p>With the ever-evolving challenges of the modern era, there is no surer way to fortify the ummah than by going back to the <b>tried-and-true system of education exemplified by Prophet Muhammad</b> ﷺ. This system centers on the Quran and Sunnah as the foundation for learning, before branching out into specialized fields. Its focus is on nurturing true <b>Muslimin</b>, <b>Mu’minin</b>, and <b>Muhsinin</b> before they embark on their paths as doctors, merchants, policeman, educators, or leaders. It instills within individuals the <b>strength of religious conviction</b> and the <b>wisdom of divine revelation</b>, empowering them to confront the complex demands of this scientific and technological age.</p>
         <p>By immersing ourselves at all levels in the Quran and Sunnah, we can not only excavate the high-quality minerals for healthier religious education competition; but also bridge the divide among Ahlu-Sunnah. Experts with deep religious understanding can stabilize political, economic and social infrastructures; and even spearhead scientific and technological advancements that preserve human nature and sustain the Islamic way of life for the afterlife. As the first five revelations, Al-‘Alaq, centered on knowledge – the restoration process must start with education. Similar to the Quran's gradual revelation over 23 years, the change must be gradual and patient. Begin small, with the family institution. Each leader, including parents, will be accountable for how they carry out their Allah-given responsibility. Hence, gently counsel your government and initiate at the grassroots level.</p>
<h4>مَا مِنْ عَبْدٍ اسْتَرْعَاهُ اللَّهُ رَعِيَّةً فَلَمْ يَحُطْهَا بِنَصِيحَةٍ إِلاَّ لَمْ يَجِدْ رَائِحَةَ الْجَنَّةِ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Sesiapa yang Allah berikan amanah kepimpinan tetapi tidak menjaga bawahannya dengan baik, dia takkan dapat menikmati bau Syurga.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"> - Rasulullah ﷺ, <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7150</p>
