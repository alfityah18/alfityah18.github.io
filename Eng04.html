        <p>“Al-wahn.” The root cause of the hardships endured by the Ummah today, including the conflict in Palestine, was explained by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 4297. This term defines physical or mental enervation or both, as exemplified in Verse 4 of Surah Maryam and Verse 139 of Surah aal-e-‘Imran. For 500 years, European colonialism, whether directly or indirectly, has deeply rooted and fostered its way of life in Islamic countries. This long-term scheme has facilitated the continued colonization of the minds of this Ummah even after gaining independence. The way of life that embraces the world and neglects the hereafter is a significant obstruction to the arrival of Allah's help. Nevertheless, the help will indeed come, as promised in <b>Verse 7 of Surah al-Isra</b>, only after we transform the condition of this Ummah, echoing the guidance in Verse 11 of Surah ar-Ra’d: <b>“Indeed, Allah would never change the condition of a people until they change what is within themselves.”</b> The question is: Do we aspire to pioneer a change in our way of life, or are we content to be remembered in history as the generation of al-wahn?</p>
<h3>Twice the Spread of Corruption</h3>
<h4>وَقَضَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَتُفْسِدُنَّ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مَرَّتَيْنِ وَلَتَعْلُنَّ عُلُوًّا كَبِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>And We conveyed to the Children of Israel in the Scripture (the Torah) that: “You will certainly cause corruption on the earth twice, and you will surely reach a degree of great haughtiness.”</b></p>
<h4>فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ أُولَىٰهُمَا بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَادًا لَّنَآ أُو۟لِى بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ فَجَاسُوا۟ خِلَٰلَ ٱلدِّيَارِۚ وَكَانَ وَعْدًا مَّفْعُولًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>So, when the first of the two promise came (for Us to punish your transgressions), We sent against you some of Our servants of great military might, and they ravaged even into your homes. And this was a promise fulfilled.</b></p>
<h4>ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ ٱلْكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَمْدَدْنَٰكُم بِأَمْوَٰلٍ وَبَنِينَ وَجَعَلْنَٰكُمْ أَكْثَرَ نَفِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Then (after your repentance), We gave back to you a return victory over them, and We reinforced you with wealth and offspring, and made you numerous in manpower.</b></p>
<h4>إِنْ أَحْسَنتُمْ أَحْسَنتُمْ لِأَنفُسِكُمْۖ وَإِنْ أَسَأْتُمْ فَلَهَاۚ فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ لِيَسُۥٓـُٔوا۟ وُجُوهَكُمْ وَلِيَدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْمَسْجِدَ كَمَا دَخَلُوهُ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَلِيُتَبِّرُوا۟ مَا عَلَوْا۟ تَتْبِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>If you act rightly, it is for your own good. But if you do wrong, it is your own loss. Then, when the final promise would come to pass (for Us to punish you once again), (We would send your enemies) to totally disgrace you and enter Al-Masjid (il-Aqsa) as (how the previous enemies) entered (Jerusalem) the first time. And they will utterly destroy whatever would fall into their hands, with total destruction.</b></p>
<h4>عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يَرْحَمَكُمْۚ وَإِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَاۘ وَجَعَلْنَا جَهَنَّمَ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ حَصِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Perhaps your Lord will show you mercy. But if you return (to transgressions), We will return (to punishment), and We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Al-Isra 17: Verse 4-8</p>
        <p>When the Quran mentions “corruption,” it refers to the various forms of corruption it addresses. Among these are <b>political hypocrisy</b> in Verse 11 of Surah al-Baqarah, <b>economic oppression</b> in Verse 85 of Surah al-A’raf, and <b>social deviation</b> in Verse 88 of Surah an-Nahl. Since ancient times, the Children of Israel have been known as an extreme nation that embodies all the forms of corruption mentioned in the Book of Allah, having even killed prophets and scholars. The first phase of their corruption has already been punished through the assault by Nebuchadnezzar II. Given the extensive corruption they have spread across the world, combined with their haughtiness, wealth, offspring, and manpower, our era can be more accurately described as the “second corruption,” especially in comparison to the destruction of the Second Temple. Moreover, Verse 4 of Surah al-Isra emphasizes how many times they caused corruption, rather than how many times their temple was destroyed.</p>
        <p>The narrative of the second corruption began well before the fall of the Ottoman Caliphate, when, in 1896, Sultan Abdul Hamid II rejected an offer from Theodor Herzl—the founder of modern political Zionism—to support Jewish settlements in Palestine. East Africa and Argentina had been offered as alternatives by the British and the Jewish Colonization Association; however, the Zionist movement concentrated on executing geopolitical manoeuvres and manipulations. By 1916, they succeeded in persuading the British, France, Russia, and the Arab Revolt to accept the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which aimed to dismantle the Ottoman Empire. A year later, the 1917 Balfour Declaration was issued, in which the British government declared Palestine to be the Jewish homeland. All of this led to the Nakba in 1948, which witnessed the large-scale ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, the Six-Day War in 1967, and various forms of oppression and injustice against the Muslim Ummah that continue to this day.</p>
        <p>The Holocaust not only provided a stronger justification for the establishment of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948, but also played a crucial role in forging a close relationship between Israel and the emerging superpower of the United States. Therefore, pro-Israel lobbying organizations, such as the American Zionist Council (AZC), which evolved into the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), were established to ensure that whoever led this new global power would continue the legacy of Zionist aspirations. While Western colonization was historically driven primarily by Christian European nations, it is now further reinforced by strategic Jewish influence. Agents of capitalism are deployed to secure global resources, with organizations like NATO and the G7 ensuring access to oil in the Middle East. Meanwhile, financial powerhouses such as BlackRock and Vanguard exert considerable influence over major corporations and economic sectors across countries, complicating the growth of local small businesses. Furthermore, the US dollar, as the world’s reserve currency, continues to shape international trade and serves as an economic instrument that can be wielded against adversaries.</p>
        <p>As explained in Verses 6 and 7 of Surah al-Isra, with the wealth, lineage, and manpower bestowed upon them by Allah, they have the capacity to choose to spread justice upon the earth. However, as revealed in Verse 96 of Surah al-Baqarah, the greed to dominate the world for a thousand years has led them down the path of tyranny. The colonisation of Palestine marks the first step in their plan to welcome a leader who is believed to fulfil their ambitions, Melekh Mashiach, known to us as Al-Masih ad-Dajjal. In preparing the "goyim" to ultimately submit to him, political hypocrisy and economic oppression must be coupled with social diversion. The goal is to ensure that humanity strays far from a religious way of life, weakening their minds, and feeding them false worldly dreams that make them forget the hereafter. The instruments for this? The media and entertainment industries. This is why Jewish figures were the founders of major film studios, record companies, publishing houses, radio stations, and global television networks. All the events and factors mentioned thus far signal that the events foretold in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2922 are drawing nearer. However, there remains one question: What did Al-Mustafa ﷺ mean by the speaking rock and tree? Let us reflect upon the following three hypotheses.</p>
<h3>Hypothesis I – Literal</h3>
<h4>تُقَاتِلُكُمُ الْيَهُودُ فَتُسَلَّطُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَتَّى يَقُولَ الْحَجَرُ يَا مُسْلِمُ هَذَا يَهُودِيٌّ وَرَائِي فَاقْتُلْهُ.‏</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“The Jews will fight you, but you will gain victory over them until the rock itself says, ‘O Muslim, there is a Jew behind me, so destroy him.’”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2921</p>
        <p><i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2921 provides further assurance of our victory, while <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2922, the main topic of discussion, narrates that the factor contributing to this victory is the speaking rocks and trees. Fascinating, isn’t it? Let us explore further together to understand its meaning. Apart from Messengers like Prophet Solomon (AS) and Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who were endowed with the unique ability to communicate with other creatures such as birds, ants, and trees; hadiths like <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 3579 and 3584 demonstrate that ordinary humans, like The Companions, were also gifted with the ability to hear other beings speak. If the meaning of the hadith is intended to be literal, it implies that the military campaign would not only be led but also composed of individuals who are very close to Allah Jalla Jalaluhu.</p>
<h3>Hypothesis II – Technology</h3>
        <p>The notion of speaking rocks and trees can allude to forms of communication that were not comprehended before the advent of science and technology in our time. The unveiling of the concealed presence may signify an “indication” – as we now identify as a tracking system; comprising Global Positioning System (GPS), Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), thermal, satellite, and various other tracking technologies. And what about the gharqad? It can refer to a place of refuge. <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2944, narrating the appearance of the Antichrist with 70,000 Jewish followers in Isfahan, may suggest that after their complete defeat, some may seek refuge there. Presently, the Jewish population in Isfahan is approximately only 1,500 individuals. If this is true, the likelihood of that war occurring during the early reign of The Mahdi, or a time preceding it, is significantly higher. And refuting the viewpoint that claims it occurs during Al-Malhamah al-Kubra, or the killing of the Antichrist by Prophet Jesus (AS).</p>
<h3>Hypothesis III – Human</h3>
        <p>Although it is well known that <b>الْحَجَرُ</b> translates to “stone,” it is also commonly used as a metaphor for the human heart, as exemplified in Verse 74 of Surah al-Baqarah, which conveys: <b>“Then your heart became as hard as a stone, or even harder...”</b> And the word <b>الشَّجَرُ</b>, meaning “tree,” is analogously employed to symbolize the virtuous words of an individual, as depicted in Verse 24-25 of Surah Ibrahim: <b>“A good word is like a good tree; its root is firm, and its branches reach towards the sky...”</b> From these two forms of usage in the Quran, we can grasp this hadith through a symbolic interpretation. This nation will garner backing from non-Muslims who had previously aligned themselves with the Children of Israel and their confederates, along with those who held a sincere affinity for truth but were led astray by their propaganda. Based on its distinct nature, as contrasted with the analogy in Verse 26 of Surah Ibrahim, the gharqad may signify the hypocrites who will betray the Muslims.</p>
        <p>This event may occur prior to, or in tandem with the episode mentioned in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 2767, where this community will join forces with the “Rome” that is committed to safeguarding spiritual values, against the alliance of wolves disguised under the sheep's clothing. Moreover, the downfall of global powers supporting Zionism may serve as an imperative factor in the triumph foretold in this hadith. Every civilization will inevitably reach its conclusion. As stated in Verse 41 of Surah ar-Rum**, every corruption shall suffer its consequences. The punishment may be tied to something they hold dear – economy, akin to the allegory outlined in Verse 32-44 of Surah al-Kahf. Among the four stories in this surah, only this tale is not a historical account, and it may well be a depiction of events yet to unfold in the near future. This is not implausible, as the world today is heading in that direction. When the financial bubble bursts, that is the moment Israel loses all the support it once enjoyed.</p>
<p class="small-text">**Corruption has spread on the land and sea due to the actions of people. Thus, He may let them taste some of the consequences of their deeds, in the hope that they might return to righteousness.</p>
<h3>Heading Towards Freedom</h3>
        <p>Upon hearing the news from Prophet Muhammad ﷺ that this ummah would conquer Constantinople, the Companions were not merely joyous and anticipatory of the arrival of the character who would fulfill these words. Resolute in their belief in destiny, they undertook fitting initiatives to ensure its manifestation. Through their efforts to unite the Arabian Peninsula and spread the message of Islam worldwide, the sultans of Turkiye emerged, striving to conquer the city, before Muhammad al-Fatih, at the age of twenty-one, validated the words of the Messenger ﷺ. Yet, here we are, only waiting for Imam Mahdi to solve all of our problems. Similar to Muhammad II, he too might necessitate foundational groundwork preparation, just as the Companions of Rasulullah ﷺ used to pave the way. We always have a choice. To persist as the scum and rubbish carried away by a torrent. Or to awaken from this prolonged slumber, and become the gold and gems of this budding generation? “What say you?”</p>
        <p>Seeking sympathy from global powers or relying on the assistance of their puppet institutions is a sign of weakness. Clearly, the hadith depicting our fate plainly illustrates that the liberation of Palestine will only be achieved through our own hands. Condemnation, protests, boycotts, donations, and prayers are noble efforts. However, with strength, we can undoubtedly take more effective measures to halt oppression and promote justice on this Earth. The small and fragmented Islamic countries today are not much different from the divided tribes before the advent of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. We need to become a unified entity to free Palestine from Israel, and Muslims from Western systems and lifestyles. And victory will come only through the help of your Lord. And the Quranic Verses about the help of Allah, such as Verse 62-63 of Surah al-Anfal, Verse 1-2 of Surah an-Nasr, and much more, conclude that today’s ummah needs to restore the era of Prophethood. The hourglass spills, urging us to act. The time is now.</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>The Ummah must fully return to the Islamic way of life in its entirety. It requires more than mere calls; Prophet Muhammad ﷺ did not stop at the stage of invitation but progressed through various phases of practical implementation. In the same manner, we must follow his example and actively work towards realisation in all Muslim countries around the world. The help of Allah will not transpire unless we reinstate the caliphate system. However, this can only be achieved through the consensus of leaders in the Muslim world whom we obey, rather than by any group trying to seize existing governance. It will not succeed through acts of terrorism. And the rotational monarchy system in Malaysia can be adopted as a practical model to ensure smooth operation. And the people must take an active role in spreading this demand, including on social media, in a civilised manner. And if this unfulfilled, be patient, and do not disobey. Persevere in pursuing this demand, from time to time, for one day, the time will arrive when this aspiration will be realized.</p>
<h4>وَأُخْرَىٰ تُحِبُّونَهَاۖ نَصْرٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَفَتْحٌ قَرِيبٌۗ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>And you will obtain another favour that you love: a help from Allah and an imminent victory. Thus, give this good news to the believers.</b></p>
