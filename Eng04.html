        <p>The primary factor contributing to the conflict in Palestine today has been intricately explained by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 4297 – “al-wahn”. This term defines physical or mental enervation or both, as exemplified in Verse 4 of Surah Maryam and Verse 139 of Surah aal-e-‘Imran. For 500 years, European colonialism has deeply rooted and fostered its way of life in Islamic countries, and this long-term scheme has facilitated the continued colonization of the minds of this ummah even after gaining independence. The way of life that embraces the world and neglects the hereafter is a significant obstruction to the arrival of Allah's help. Nevertheless, the help will indeed come, as promised in <b>Verse 7 of Surah al-Isra</b>, only after we transform the condition of this ummah, echoing the guidance in Verse 11 of Surah ar-Ra’d*. The question is: Do we aspire to pioneer a change in our way of life, or are we content to be remembered in history as the generation of al-wahn?</p>
<p class="small-text">*Indeed, Allah would never change the condition of a people until they change what is within themselves.</p>
<h4>وَقَضَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَتُفْسِدُنَّ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مَرَّتَيْنِ وَلَتَعْلُنَّ عُلُوًّا كَبِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>And We conveyed to the Children of Israel in the Scripture (the Torah) that: “You will certainly cause corruption on the earth twice, and you will surely reach a degree of great haughtiness.”</b></p>
<h4>فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ أُولَىٰهُمَا بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَادًا لَّنَآ أُو۟لِى بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ فَجَاسُوا۟ خِلَٰلَ ٱلدِّيَارِۚ وَكَانَ وَعْدًا مَّفْعُولًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>So, when the first of the two promise came (for Us to punish your transgressions), We sent against you some of Our servants of great military might, and they ravaged even into your homes. And this was a promise fulfilled.</b></p>
<h4>ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ ٱلْكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَمْدَدْنَٰكُم بِأَمْوَٰلٍ وَبَنِينَ وَجَعَلْنَٰكُمْ أَكْثَرَ نَفِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Then (after your repentance), We gave back to you a return victory over them, and We reinforced you with wealth and offspring, and made you numerous in manpower.</b></p>
<h4>إِنْ أَحْسَنتُمْ أَحْسَنتُمْ لِأَنفُسِكُمْۖ وَإِنْ أَسَأْتُمْ فَلَهَاۚ فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ لِيَسُۥٓـُٔوا۟ وُجُوهَكُمْ وَلِيَدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْمَسْجِدَ كَمَا دَخَلُوهُ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَلِيُتَبِّرُوا۟ مَا عَلَوْا۟ تَتْبِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>If you act rightly, it is for your own good. But if you do wrong, it is your own loss. Then, when the final promise would come to pass (for Us to punish you once again), (We would send your enemies) to totally disgrace you and enter Al-Masjid (il-Aqsa) as (how the previous enemies) entered (Jerusalem) the first time. And they will utterly destroy whatever would fall into their hands, with total destruction.</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Al-Isra 17: Verse 4-7</p>
        <p>The initial “corruption” caused by the Children of Israel has long been chronicled in history, and the second “corruption” has indeed transpired in our lifetime. This manifestation began with the Balfour Declaration on November 2, 1917, which publicly committing to the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. This pivotal moment subsequently triggered the Nakbah – the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in 1948, the Six-Day War in 1967, and a series of ongoing oppressions and injustices against the Muslim community. These events suggest that divine retribution is imminent, with the exact timing known only to Allah, the All-Knowing. The hadith we are discussing serves as a continuation and elaboration of these Verses, in addition to other narrations found in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2921, conveying a promising message of our eventual triumph. However, when The Chosen One ﷺ referred to <b>speaking rocks and trees</b>, what does he mean? Let us explore these three hypotheses together.</p>
<h3>Hypothesis I – Literal</h3>
        <p>Apart from Messengers like Prophet Solomon (AS) and Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who were endowed with the peculiar ability to communicate with creatures such as birds, ants, and trees; hadiths like <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 3579 and 3584 demonstrate that ordinary humans, like The Companions, were also gifted with the ability to hear other beings speak. This indicates that the Muslims of that era had revived Prophethood and possessed what we do not have for a hundred years now – a Caliph. It is crucial for us not to misinterpret both scriptures; they do not imply genocide. Rather, they vividly illustrate intense battles between military forces. Some of us are already aware that Israel's colonization of Palestine primarily serves as preparation for the arrival of their Melekh Mashiach. Therefore, the “destruction” mentioned in Verse 7 of Surah al-Isra may possibly allude to the establishment of their Third Temple in the near future, hinting at the potential of the complete takeover of the Promised Land by them. </p>
<h3>Hypothesis II – Technology</h3>
        <p>The notion of speaking rocks and trees can allude to forms of communication that were not comprehended before the advent of science and technology in our time. The unveiling of the concealed presence may signify an “indication” – as we now identify as a tracking system; comprising Global Positioning System (GPS), Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), thermal, satellite, and various other tracking technologies. And what about the gharqad? It can refer to a place of refuge. <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2944, narrating the appearance of the Antichrist with 70,000 Jewish followers in Isfahan, may suggest that after their complete defeat, some may seek refuge there. Presently, the Jewish population in Isfahan is approximately only 1,500 individuals. If this is true, the likelihood of that war occurring during the early reign of The Mahdi, or a time preceding it, is significantly higher. And refuting the viewpoint that claims it occurs during Al-Malhamah al-Kubra, or the killing of the Antichrist by Prophet Jesus (AS).</p>
<h3>Hypothesis III – Human</h3>
        <p>Although it is well known that <b>الْحَجَرُ</b> translates to “stone,” it is also commonly used as a metaphor for the human heart, as exemplified in Verse 74 of Surah al-Baqarah, which conveys: <b>“Then your heart became as hard as a stone, or even harder...”</b> And the word <b>الشَّجَرُ</b>, meaning “tree,” is analogously employed to symbolize the virtuous words of an individual, as depicted in Verse 24-25 of Surah Ibrahim: <b>“A good word is like a good tree; its root is firm, and its branches reach towards the sky...”</b> From these two forms of usage in the Quran, we can grasp this hadith through a symbolic interpretation. This nation will garner backing from non-Muslims who had previously aligned themselves with the Children of Israel and their confederates, along with those who held a sincere affinity for truth but were led astray by their propaganda. Based on its distinct nature, as contrasted with the analogy in Verse 26 of Surah Ibrahim, the gharqad may signify the hypocrites who will betray the Muslims.</p>
        <p>This event may occur prior to, or in tandem with the episode mentioned in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 2767, where this community will join forces with the “Rome” that is committed to safeguarding spiritual values, against the alliance of wolves disguised under the sheep's clothing. Moreover, the downfall of global powers supporting the Zionist Regime may serve as an imperative factor in the triumph foretold in this hadith. Every civilization will inevitably reach its conclusion. As stated in Verse 41 of Surah ar-Rum**, every corruption shall suffer its consequences. The punishment may be tied to something they hold dear – economy, akin to the allegory outlined in Verses 32-44 of Surah al-Kahf. Among the four stories in this surah, only this tale is not a historical account, and it may well be a depiction of events yet to unfold in the near future. This is not implausible, as the world today is heading in that direction. When the financial bubble bursts, that is the moment Israel loses all the support it once enjoyed.</p>
<p class="small-text">**Corruption has spread on the land and sea due to the actions of people. Thus, He may let them taste some of the consequences of their deeds, in the hope that they might return to righteousness.</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>Upon hearing the news from Prophet Muhammad ﷺ that this ummah would conquer Constantinople, the Companions were not merely joyous and anticipatory of the arrival of the character who would fulfill these words. Resolute in their belief in destiny, they undertook fitting initiatives to ensure its manifestation. Through their efforts to unite the Arabian Peninsula and spread the message of Islam worldwide, the sultans of Turkiye emerged, striving to conquer the city, before Muhammad al-Fatih, at the age of twenty-one, validated the words of the Rasulullah ﷺ.</p>

<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>And you will obtain another favour that you love: a help from Allah and an imminent victory. Thus, give this good news to the believers.</b></p>
