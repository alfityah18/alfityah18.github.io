        <p>“Al-wahn.” The root cause of the hardships endured by the Ummah today, including the conflict in Palestine, was explained by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 4297. This term defines physical or mental enervation or both, as exemplified in Verse 4 of Surah Maryam and Verse 139 of Surah aal-e-‘Imran. For 500 years, European colonialism, whether directly or indirectly, has deeply rooted and fostered its way of life in Islamic countries. This long-term scheme has facilitated the continued colonization of the minds of this Ummah even after gaining independence.</p> 
        <p>The way of life that embraces the world and neglects the hereafter is a significant obstruction to the arrival of Allah's help. Nevertheless, the help will indeed come, as promised in <b>Verse 7 of Surah al-Isra</b>, only after we transform the condition of this Ummah, echoing the guidance in Verse 11 of Surah ar-Ra’d: <b>“Indeed, Allah would never change the condition of a people until they change what is within themselves.”</b> The question is: Do we aspire to pioneer a change in our way of life, or are we content to be remembered in history as the generation of al-wahn?</p>
<h3>Twice the Spread of Corruption</h3>
<h4>وَقَضَيْنَآ إِلَىٰ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ فِى ٱلْكِتَٰبِ لَتُفْسِدُنَّ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مَرَّتَيْنِ وَلَتَعْلُنَّ عُلُوًّا كَبِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>And We conveyed to the Children of Israel in the Scripture (the Torah) that: “You will certainly cause corruption on the earth twice, and you will surely reach a degree of great haughtiness.”</b></p>
<h4>فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ أُولَىٰهُمَا بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَادًا لَّنَآ أُو۟لِى بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ فَجَاسُوا۟ خِلَٰلَ ٱلدِّيَارِۚ وَكَانَ وَعْدًا مَّفْعُولًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>So, when the first of the two promise came (for Us to punish your transgressions), We sent against you some of Our servants of great military might, and they ravaged even into your homes. And this was a promise fulfilled.</b></p>
<h4>ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ ٱلْكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَمْدَدْنَٰكُم بِأَمْوَٰلٍ وَبَنِينَ وَجَعَلْنَٰكُمْ أَكْثَرَ نَفِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Then (after your repentance), We gave back to you a return victory over them, and We reinforced you with wealth and offspring, and made you numerous in manpower.</b></p>
<h4>إِنْ أَحْسَنتُمْ أَحْسَنتُمْ لِأَنفُسِكُمْۖ وَإِنْ أَسَأْتُمْ فَلَهَاۚ فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ لِيَسُۥٓـُٔوا۟ وُجُوهَكُمْ وَلِيَدْخُلُوا۟ ٱلْمَسْجِدَ كَمَا دَخَلُوهُ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَلِيُتَبِّرُوا۟ مَا عَلَوْا۟ تَتْبِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>If you act rightly, it is for your own good. But if you do wrong, it is your own loss. Then, when the final promise would come to pass (for Us to punish you once again), (We would send your enemies) to totally disgrace you and enter Al-Masjid (il-Aqsa) as (how the previous enemies) entered (Jerusalem) the first time. And they will utterly destroy whatever would fall into their hands, with total destruction.</b></p>
<h4>عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يَرْحَمَكُمْۚ وَإِنْ عُدتُّمْ عُدْنَاۘ وَجَعَلْنَا جَهَنَّمَ لِلْكَٰفِرِينَ حَصِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Perhaps your Lord will show you mercy. But if you return (to transgressions), We will return (to punishment), and We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Al-Isra 17: Verse 4-8</p>
        <p>When the Quran mentions “corruption,” it refers to the various forms of corruption it addresses. Among these are <b>political hypocrisy</b> in Verse 11 of Surah al-Baqarah, <b>economic oppression</b> in Verse 85 of Surah al-A’raf, and <b>social deviation</b> in Verse 88 of Surah an-Nahl. Since ancient times, the Children of Israel have been known as an extreme nation that embodies all the forms of corruption mentioned in the Book of Allah, having even killed prophets and scholars.</p> 
        <p>The first phase of their corruption has already been punished through the assault by Nebuchadnezzar II. Given the extensive corruption they have spread across the world, combined with their haughtiness, wealth, offspring, and manpower, our era can be more accurately described as the “second corruption,” especially in comparison to the destruction of the Second Temple. Moreover, Verse 4 of Surah al-Isra emphasizes how many times they caused corruption, rather than how many times their temple was destroyed.</p>
        <p>The narrative of the second corruption began well before the fall of the Ottoman Caliphate, when, in 1896, Sultan Abdul Hamid II rejected an offer from Theodor Herzl—the founder of modern political Zionism—to support Jewish settlements in Palestine. East Africa and Argentina had been offered as alternatives by the British and the Jewish Colonization Association; however, the Zionist movement concentrated on executing geopolitical manoeuvres and manipulations.</p> 
        <p>By 1916, they succeeded in persuading the British, France, Russia, and the Arab Revolt* to accept the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which aimed to dismantle the Ottoman Empire. A year later, the 1917 Balfour Declaration was issued, in which the British government declared Palestine to be the Jewish homeland. All of this led to the Nakba in 1948, which witnessed the large-scale ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, the Six-Day War in 1967, and various forms of oppression and injustice against the Muslim Ummah that continue to this day.</p>
<p class="small-text">*The Arab Revolt were involved in a contradictory manner, ultimately falling victim to the deception of the parties at play.</p>
        <p>The Holocaust not only provided a stronger justification for the establishment of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948, but also played a crucial role in forging a close relationship between Israel and the emerging superpower of the United States. Therefore, pro-Israel lobbying organizations, such as the American Zionist Council (AZC), which evolved into the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), were established to ensure that whoever led this new global power would continue the legacy of Zionist aspirations.</p> 
        <p>While Western colonization was historically driven primarily by Christian European nations, it is now further reinforced by strategic Jewish influence. Agents of capitalism are deployed to secure global resources, with organizations like NATO and the G7 ensuring access to oil in the Middle East. Meanwhile, financial powerhouses such as BlackRock and Vanguard exert considerable influence over major corporations and economic sectors across countries, complicating the growth of local small businesses. Furthermore, the US dollar, as the world’s reserve currency, continues to shape international trade and serves as an economic instrument that can be wielded against adversaries.</p>
        <p>As explained in Verses 6 and 7 of Surah al-Isra, with the wealth, lineage, and manpower bestowed upon them by Allah, they have the capacity to choose to spread justice upon the earth. However, as revealed in Verse 96 of Surah al-Baqarah, the greed to dominate the world for a thousand years has led them down the path of tyranny. The colonisation of Palestine marks the first step in their plan to welcome a leader who is believed to fulfil their ambitions, Melekh Mashiach, known to us as Al-Masih ad-Dajjal.</p> 
        <p>In preparing the "goyim" to ultimately submit to him, political hypocrisy and economic oppression must be coupled with social diversion. The goal is to ensure that humanity strays far from a religious way of life, weakening their minds, and feeding them false worldly dreams that make them forget the hereafter. The instruments for this? The media and entertainment industries. This is why Jewish figures were the founders of major film studios, record companies, publishing houses, radio stations, and global television networks.</p> 
        <p>All the events and factors mentioned thus far signal that the events foretold in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2922 are drawing nearer. However, there remains one question: What did Al-Mustafa ﷺ mean by the speaking rock and tree? Let us reflect upon the following three hypotheses.</p>
<h3>Hypothesis I – Literal</h3>
<h4>تُقَاتِلُكُمُ الْيَهُودُ فَتُسَلَّطُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَتَّى يَقُولَ الْحَجَرُ يَا مُسْلِمُ هَذَا يَهُودِيٌّ وَرَائِي فَاقْتُلْهُ.‏</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“The Jews will fight you, but you will gain victory over them until the rock itself says, ‘O Muslim, there is a Jew behind me, so destroy him.’”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2921</p>
        <p><i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2921 provides further assurance of our victory, while <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2922, the main topic of discussion, narrates that the factor contributing to this victory is the speaking rocks and trees. Fascinating, isn’t it? Let us explore further together to understand its meaning. Apart from Messengers like Prophet Solomon (AS) and Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who were endowed with the unique ability to communicate with other creatures such as birds, ants, and trees; hadiths like <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 3579 and 3584 demonstrate that ordinary humans, like The Companions, were also gifted with the ability to hear other beings speak.</p> 
        <p>If the meaning of the hadith is intended to be literal, it implies that the military campaign would not only be led but also composed of individuals who are very close to Allah Jalla Jalaluhu. Given that such ability was granted during the period of Prophethood, there is a strong possibility that it will be bestowed once more in the upcoming era of Prophethood. Just as it occurred during the time of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, this extraordinary ability to hear other beings speak could reemerge during the return of Prophet Jesus (AS), and perhaps even before that, in the era of Al-Mahdi, as his reign is a phase of Minhaj an-Nubuwwah.</p>
        <p>However, we must not dismiss the possibility that this battle could occur before the era of Imam Mahdi and Prophet Jesus ﷺ; during the period when the foundational groundwork of Prophethood is being laid, prior to Al-Mahdi completing it, should that be the sequence of events. At that time, they would already possess what we have lacked for the past hundred years—a Caliph. It is crucial not to misinterpret these texts, as they clearly describe an intense conflict between two opposing military forces, not a genocide.</p> 
        <p>Furthermore, these narrations imply that Islamic law will once again be fully implemented—most notably, within the context of this hadith, hirabah—an anti-terrorism law decreed by Allah Ta’ala through Verse 33 of Surah al-Maidah. It upholds justice that is not afforded today to civilians, the elderly, women, and children of Palestine who are being killed by the Zionist regime.</p> 
        <p>In this age of science and technology, many, including Muslims influenced by Western thinking, may find this literal hypothesis unbelievable. However, know that we will be entering a transitional period, where science today will no longer be able to explain what is to come—where events like the metamorphosis in Franz Kafka’s fiction will become a reality, as foretold in <i>Sunan Ibn Majah</i> 4060. Take the necessary steps.</p>
<h3>Hypothesis II – Science & Technology</h3>
        <p>This hadith itself serves as a compelling reason to argue that the events it describes will occur during the era of Prophethood or at the time its foundation is laid. This is because, contrary to the narrative in <i>Sunan Abu Dawud</i> 4297, Islam’s enemies were already instilled with fear of us, indicating that the generation of that time was free from the ailment of al-wahn, which has reached its peak in this age of Mulkan Jabariyyan. The façade of bravery worn by the Jews will be torn away, exposing their true nature as cowards, as described by Allah (SWT) in verse 14 of Surah al-Hashr.</p> 
        <p>Furthermore, this hadith strengthens the claim that the “second corruption” is more accurately said to occur in our time, particularly if the reference to the speaking rocks and trees is understood as an allusion to the language of science and technology—forms of communication unimaginable in earlier eras. The rocks and trees’ unveiling of concealed presences could signify “indication,” which we now recognise as modern tracking systems encompassing technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), thermal detection, satellite systems, and others.</p>
        <p>And what about the gharqad tree? To begin with, gharqad refers to plants in the genus <i>Lycium</i>, particularly <i>Lycium shawii</i>, which is commonly used in traditional medicine in the Arabian Peninsula. Currently, it holds no significant place in Judaism, except for a single mention in the Bible, in the Book of Judges. Even then, it is portrayed negatively, as Jotham likens his half-brother Abimelech to <i>Lycium</i>—a worthless tree capable only of causing harm with its thorns. Moreover, it is not cultivated on a large scale in Israel, contrary to claims made by certain celebrity preachers and conspiracy theorists.</p> 
        <p>If the reference is literal, we cannot entirely dismiss the possibility that its cultivation may occur in the future, or that the war may occur in another location filled with those trees. However, if it is symbolic of technology, gharqad could represent counter-technologies that neutralize detection systems, such as signal disruption technologies, stealth or infiltration methods, and obfuscation tools. It could also refer to more advanced technologies, either currently in development or theorized for the future, such as quantum cloaking, meta-materials, or nanotechnology.</p>
<h3>Hypothesis III – Human</h3>
        <p>Although it is well known that <b>الْحَجَرُ</b> translates to “rock,” it is also commonly used as a metaphor for the human heart, as exemplified in Verse 74 of Surah al-Baqarah, which conveys: <b>“Then your heart became as hard as a stone, or even harder...”</b> And the word <b>الشَّجَرُ</b>, meaning “tree,” is analogously employed to symbolize the virtuous words of an individual, as depicted in Verse 24-25 of Surah Ibrahim: <b>“A good word is like a good tree; its root is firm, and its branches reach towards the sky...”</b></p> 
        <p>From these two forms of usage in the Quran, we can grasp this hadith through a symbolic interpretation pertaining to humanity. The Quranic Verses suggest that “rocks” could symbolize non-Muslims who initially sided with the Children of Israel but later turned to support the military campaign. In contrast, “trees” represent non-Muslims who have always valued justice but are only now awakening from the spell of long-standing propaganda.</p> 
        <p>As Allah declares in Surah aal-e-‘Imran, Verse 54: <b>“They plan, and Allah plans. And Allah is the best of planners.”</b> No superpower will endure forever. Even economic giants will inevitably fall when their time comes. The erosion of their influence marks the beginning. Their legacy media is no longer trusted, and their entertainment industry is increasingly seen as corrupt. Only the gharqad, “the worthless tree,” continues to support them. Tick! Tock! Tick! Tock!</p>
<h3>When Will It Occur?</h3>
<h4>يَنْزِلُ الدَّجَّالُ فِي هَذِهِ السَّبَخَةِ بِمَرّ ِقَنَاةَ، فَيَكُونُ أَكْثَرَ مَنْ يَخْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ النِّسَاءُ، حَتَّى إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ لَيَرْجِعُ إِلَى حَمِيمِهِ وَإِلَى أُمِّهِ وَابْنَتِهِ وَأُخْتِهِ وَعَمَّتِهِ، فَيُوثِقُهَا رِبَاطًا، مَخَافَةَ أَنْ تَخْرُجَ إِلَيْهِ، ثُمَّ يُسَلِّطُ اللهُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ عَلَيْهِ، فَيَقْتُلُونَهُ وَيَقْتُلُونَ شِيعَتَهُ، حَتَّى إِنَّ الْيَهُودِيَّ، لَيَخْتَبِئُ تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَةِ أَوِ الْحَجَرِ فَيَقُولُ الْحَجَرُ أَوِ الشَّجَرَةُ لِلْمُسْلِمِ: هَذَا يَهُودِيٌّ تَحْتِي فَاقْتُلْهُ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“The Dajjal will descend upon this barren land, at Marr Qanah. At that time, the majority of those flocking to him will be women. Their inclination will be such that a man will return to his close relations—his mother, daughter, sister, or aunt—and bind them firmly to prevent them from going out to him.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“Then, Allah will empower the Muslims against him, and they will destroy him and his followers. Even a Jew will hide behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say to a Muslim, ‘Here is a Jew hiding behind me; come and destroy him.’”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, <i>Musnad Ahmad</i> 5353</p>     
        <p>This hadith, also narrated by Imam At-Tabarani (RH) in Mu'jam al-Awsat, has been deemed authentic by Sheikh Ahmad Shakir (RH). As Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (RH) did—if we link this hadith with <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2922, the main topic of this discussion—it becomes evident that the battle will take place during the era of Prophet Jesus (AS), which will culminate in the death of the Antichrist in the city of Lod, located 15 km from Tel Aviv. Not only does this support Hypothesis I as being more accurate, but it also conveys an unsettling message: that Palestine will not gain independence until that moment arrives. How long from now that will be, only Allah knows.</p> 
        <p>Furthermore, the phrase <b>“They will utterly destroy whatever would fall into their hands, with total destruction”</b> from Verse 7 of Surah al-Isra may well refer to the Third Temple, which is foreseen to be successfully built. This suggests the possibility of Palestine suffering a complete defeat. In fact, the Greater Israel expansion plan may even come to fruition, aligning with the words of Rasulullah ﷺ in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 4294: <b>“The flourishing of Jerusalem is a sign of the ruin of Madinah.”</b> If that is the destiny, the entirety of Palestine, Jordan, and Lebanon, along with parts of Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and possibly even Saudi Arabia, would fall under their dominion.</p>
        <p>If so, what is the necessity of discussing the other two hypotheses? This is because asserting that the battle mentioned in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2922 will take place before the advent of Al-Masih (AS) is a stronger position.</p> 
        <p>The first point is that while some hadith scholars consider <i>Musnad Ahmad</i> 5353 to be authentic, many others, in fact a greater number, regard it as weak. This includes Sheikh Al-Albani (RH) in <i>Qisat ul-Masih id-Dajjal</i> and even Al-Hafiz Nuruddin al-Haythami (RH), who, in his magnum opus <i>Majma’ uz-Zawaid</i>, evaluated one of its narrators, Ibn Ishaq, as a <i>mudallis</i>—generally understood to be someone who obscures defects in the chain of narration.</p> 
        <p>The second point refers to Verses 4 to 8 of Surah Al-Isra, which outline the chronology of the corruption spread by the Children of Israel. Verse 5 addresses the first corruption, while Verse 7 describes the final instance. However, Allah Ta’ala does not end the narrative of this section at Verse 7. Instead, it concludes with a warning in Verse 8, indicating that they will repeat their misdeeds. At that time, they will no longer be the protagonists in the narrative of corruption, as they were in Verses 4 to 7, but merely supporting characters, followers of the central figure of greater evil: the false Messiah. This suggests that the battle will take place before the emergence of the greatest fitna in the end times.</p>
        <p>The third point refers to <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2900, which states that we will conquer the Arabian Peninsula, followed by Iran and Europe, before the Antichrist. Some interpret this as indicating that the conquests of Arabia and Persia have already occurred, while others believe these events will take place during the era of Al-Mahdi.</p>
        <p>The fourth point is derived from <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2944, which mentions that the first appearance of the Dajjal will be in Isfahan, Iran. The question arises: why not in Israel? This suggests that Israel may first suffer defeat and expulsion before their “saviour” arrives. Additionally, Al-Mahdi's reign of seven years is not merely a coincidence but corresponds to the “Seven Years of Tribulation” in Jewish eschatology.</p>
        <p>And the fifth point refers to the saying of the Prophet ﷺ, recorded in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 2535, which speaks of a caliphate centred in Ard al-Muqaddasah or the Holy Land. It may refer to Jerusalem.</p>
<h3>From Guidance to Vision</h3>
<h4>وَمَا لَكُمْ لَا تُقَٰتِلُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ ٱلرِّجَالِ وَٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْوِلْدَٰنِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْ هَٰذِهِ ٱلْقَرْيَةِ ٱلظَّالِمِ أَهْلُهَا وَٱجْعَل لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ وَلِيًّا وَٱجْعَل لَّنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ نَصِيرًا</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>And what is wrong with you? That you do not fight in the cause of Allah and for those who are weak—men, women, and children—who cry out, “Our Lord, take us out of this land of oppressors. Appoint for us from Yourself a protector, and appoint for us from Yourself a helper.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">An-Nisa 4: Verse 75</p>
        <p>Verse 75 of Surah An-Nisa serves as a response to those who ask, <i>“Why does Allah not help Palestine?”</i> It also prompts us to reflect on our condition as the generation of Al-Wahn today.</p> 
        <p>When the Companions of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ heard the news that this Ummah would conquer Constantinople, they did not merely rejoice and passively await the arrival of the figure who would fulfil this prophecy. Believing in the destiny that lay ahead, they took the necessary steps to ensure its realisation. It was through their efforts to unite the Arabian Peninsula and spread the message of Islam to the far corners of the world that the sultans of Turkiye emerged—leaders who strove to conquer the city. Ultimately, it was Muhammad al-Fatih, at the age of twenty-one, who fulfilled the Prophet’s ﷺ words.</p>
        <p>At this point, we should have already understood that Palestine will only achieve freedom through the path mentioned in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2922. Emulating the faith of the Companions in the destiny that lies ahead, we ought to have a plan in place to work towards that goal, even if it requires some time.</p>
        <p>The first step is to cure the Ummah of the enervating plague of Al-Wahn. To regain strength, the required vaccine lies in the Quran and the Sunnah. A firm understanding of Tawheed and adherence to the Sunnah—practiced sincerely in the heart, expressed on the tongue, and embodied through actions in daily life—will liberate an individual from the shackles of worldly attachment and cultivate a vision far greater than mere aspirations confined to this transient realm. This healing process demands relentless effort on a global scale, to save as many as possible, and to nurture individuals capable of advancing the second step.</p>
        <p>The second step requires leaders who excel both in statesmanship and religious principles to restore the Caliphate system and Prophethood by uniting the fragmented and smaller Muslim nations. This must be achieved through the consensus of the governments of Muslim countries at the time, rather than by specific groups seeking to overthrow existing administrations. Such efforts cannot succeed through violent means. It is not merely about liberating Palestine, but about freeing the world from the divisive Western political systems, their oppressive economic structures, and their misguided social frameworks.</p>
        <p>No matter how small your efforts may seem, know that Allah is All-Appreciative, and He will bestow great rewards for our sacrifices, which, in truth, are not as significant as we might think. O slumbering lions, rise!</p>
<h4>وَأُخْرَىٰ تُحِبُّونَهَاۖ نَصْرٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَفَتْحٌ قَرِيبٌۗ وَبَشِّرِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>And you will obtain another favour that you love: a help from Allah and an imminent victory. Thus, give this good news to the believers.</b></p>
