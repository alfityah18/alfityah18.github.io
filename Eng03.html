        <p>It is incorrect to view this authentic* hadith or any narratives about fitan as mere conveyors of distressing news. Every revelation is guidance, and the hadith of fitan has already been understood as a specific guide for the people of the end times. The first guidance from this hadith is a reminder that Allah’s trials never transcend His servants’ capabilities, as He affirms in Verse 286 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>“Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity.”</b> The khabar showcases how Allah’s judgements adapt to diverse eras and circumstances. At the end of times, a period marked by the weakening of Islam, the surge of ignorance, sinfulness, and oppression, and a decrease in the faithful supporters; it is essential to recognize that Muslims will be pardoned for shortcomings. However, this leniency is attributed to their inherent limitations, not negligence on their part.</p>
<p class="small-text">*The hadith was graded as Sahih/Authentic by Al-Albani (RH) in <i>Al-Silsilah as-Sahihah</i> 2510.</p>
        <p>The second guidance relates to the Messenger ﷺ's emphasis on the proliferation of preachers compared to scholars at the twilight of times. Gaining insights from the utterance of ‘Ali (RA) in <i>Sunan ad-Darimi</i> 261 and Anas ibn Malik (RA) in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7068, the ratio of preachers to scholars could potentially extend even to 9:1. <b>الله أعلم</b>. Furthermore, this highlights their distinct roles, particularly in an era where societal shifts blur the lines between the two. However, this distinction does not negate the fact that some preachers do possess scholarly attributes. If we assess the definitions of these two roles purely based on their usage in the present era, we will not observe any significant distinction. To understand the consequences of the abundance of preachers and scarcity of scholars on the ummah today, our thorough exploration begins with the origin of <b>“الخطباء.”</b> Join me as we travel back in time.</p>
<h3>The Origin of “Khutaba”</h3>
        <p>In the context of ancient Arabia, a khatib assumed the mantle of a prominent tribal spokesperson during the era of Jahiliyyah and the early stages of Islam. His role was to impart exhortations and admonishments, known as khutbah, from the pulpit; which encompassed various forms of expression, including sermon, speech, oration, or discourse, often recited in rhyming prose, and also mixed with verses of poetry. The "khutbah’s" roots are believed to trace back to the utterances of the khatib, who skillfully employed beautiful prose to celebrate the virtues and the achievements of their tribe members while disparaging the weaknesses and the losses of their adversaries. This tradition offered a very effective platform for conveying important messages and also rallying tribal sentiment.</p>
        <p>The arrival of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ heralded a transformative elevation and revolutionization of the old khutbah. This evolution entailed a shift from a role that once fueled tribal animosity through preaching to that of a leader who actively promotes unity under one religion. Also, the transition extended from the communication of tribe-specific messages to the diffusion of universally beneficial knowledge. Further transformation was seen in the approach, as it evolved from relying on eloquent prose based on personal opinions and human ideas to embracing distinct guidance rooted in the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah. These radical shifts, embraced and exemplified by the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ, have shaped the khutbah into what we recognize today.</p>
<h3>Contrasting Attributes: Khutaba vs Ulama</h3>
<h3>1. Role</h3>
        <p>It is evident that the distinction between preachers and scholars mentioned in the hadith is indicative of the historical context of that time. Extracting insights from this context, we can connect these differences to our era. At first glance, the roles of preachers and scholars may appear similar – in general, to guide this ummah toward goodness: impart what Allah has made obligatory upon them, and warn against what He has prohibited for them. However, history teaches us a distinctive aspect. <b>If one assumes a role that divides this ummah – they do not deserve to be called alim</b>, regardless of whether they hold a doctorate because they merely went back to what Rasulullah ﷺ had changed. Unaware, <b>they are playing the role of preachers during the period of Jahiliyyah</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Fanaticism</b> was the catalyst for social divisions during those times, and the same holds true today. While divisions in the past were among tribes, now they extend not only among those deviant sects, but also within Ahlu Sunnah itself; <b>sectarian fanaticism</b> has emerged within schools of jurisprudence, theology, methodologies, and even reform movements. Surely, intolerance can lead to hateful actions and behaviours. When such preachers embrace such a stance, they not only have the potential to influence their own followers, but also, unwittingly, to foster extremists and takfiris, which undoubtedly worsens the situation. Fanaticism not only weakens this ummah but also erodes the civilization built by the Prophet ﷺ. It is no wonder that we are still caught up in the grip of the Order of Tyranny* era. Achieving unity requires that we wholeheartedly take crucial steps to adopt <b>moderation</b>, a profound wisdom taught by Verse 125 of Surah an-Nahl.</p>
<p class="small-text">*“Mulkan Jabariyyan”, reported by Ahmad & Abu Dawud, graded Sahih by Al-Albani in <i>Al-Silsilah as-Sahihah</i> 1/34 no. 5.</p>
<h4>ٱدْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِٱلْحِكْمَةِ وَٱلْمَوْعِظَةِ ٱلْحَسَنَةِۖ وَجَٰدِلْهُم بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُۚ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and kind advice, and argue with them in the best manner.</b></p>
        <p>On the contrary, a scholar follows in the footsteps initiated by Nabi ﷺ and continued by the Companions – uniting the ummah, across diverse schools; recognizing the differences within Ahlu Sunnah as an advantage to enhance understanding in this religion. In line with the statement of Abu Darda (RA) in <i>Sunan ad-Darimi</i> 295 which asserts that true scholars are those who put their knowledge into practice, they exemplify the teaching of Verse 103 of Surah aal-e-‘Imran: <b>“And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together, and do not be divided,”</b> while also complying with the caution of their Lord, The Exalted in Might in Verse 85 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>“So do you believe in some of the Scripture and reject the rest?”</b> Those who genuinely embody <b>الْخَشْيَةُ</b>**, a distinct quality among scholars stated in Verse 28 of Surah Fatir; undoubtedly possess compassion towards the community, understand their conditions in the end times, and have a deep love for unity. Unfortunately, their numbers are diminishing.</p>

<h3>2. Intention</h3>
        <p>Captivated by the fame and riches of one celebrity preacher, X was inspired to delve into religious studies. This led him to pursue education at an Islamic university in the Arabian Peninsula. After obtaining his degree, by emulating his icon, he turned into a celebrity preacher himself. He began to hold his knowledge in high regard, deeming himself more intelligent, insightful, and even more educated than others. He harnessed his acquired knowledge to contend with the ulama, debate those less informed, and captivate attention by demonstrating his mastery in memorizing the Quran, Hadith, and scholarly works. After gaining fame and wealth, he ceased to seek further knowledge, convinced that he possessed enough. His followers hailed him as a renowned scholar. And so, he lives contentedly, savoring all the respect and praise.</p>
        <p>In this fictional story, which part of X’s journey do you believe he did wrong? The most obvious is when he became arrogant about his acquired knowledge. As stated in <i>Musnad Abi Ya’la</i> 6698, Rasulullah ﷺ said that: <b>“They are among you from this ummah, and they are the fuel for the Hellfire.”</b> But not everyone knows that  apart from pursuing beneficial knowledge, every aspect of X’s appears to be misguided, right from the start. The love of fame marks the inception of all evil. X embarked on his journey with fame and wealth, clearly displaying worldly intentions, a path that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ cautioned against in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 3664: <b>“Whoever acquires knowledge that should be sought seeking the pleasure of Allah (AWJ), but acquires it only to gain some worldly advantage, will not experience the fragrance of Paradise.”</b> X should have known this better.</p>
        <p>Even though he already possessed knowledge, X made no effort to correct his ill intentions; in fact, they grew worse. His routine of criticizing scholars, arguing with the ignorant, and seeking the limelight served as reasons for Allah (SWT) to admit him into the Hellfire, as conveyed in the words of Rasulullah ﷺ in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2654. Despite being hailed as a scholar by the public, his obsession with his own knowledge revealed that he was, in fact, a jahil. This sentiment echoes the words of Masruq ibn al-Ajda’ (RH) in <i>Sunan ad-Darimi</i> 385. And his decision to cease seeking knowledge does not align with the qualities of a true scholar. For in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2686, the Prophet ﷺ stated: <b>“The believer will never be satisfied with goodness he hears, until he ends up in Paradise.”</b> The ending of X's story may seem like a good ending, but there is a twist. The true ending for someone like X is as described in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 1905, in the hereafter. Rasul ﷺ said:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“A man who acquired knowledge and imparted it to others and recited the Quran will be brought forward. Allah will make him recount His blessings, and he will admit to enjoying them in his lifetime. Then Allah will ask, “What did you do in return?”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>He will respond, “I acquired knowledge, disseminated it, and recited the Quran seeking Your pleasure.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>But Allah will say, “You have lied! You acquired knowledge only to be called a scholar, and you recited the Quran only to be known as a qari, and such has been said.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Orders will then be passed against him, and he will be dragged with his face downward and cast into the Fire.”</b></p>
        <p>X's downfall began with the influence of <b>celebrity culture</b>. Famous individuals have existed since the time of the first man: the Messengers, their Companions, the Successors, scholars, kings, politicians, authors, actors, singers, sportsmen, and many others. They were famous, yet not all of them sought fame or wealth, especially the believers. And the concept of celebrity culture has been present since ancient civilizations. Modern celebrity culture re-emerged in the 18th century, driven by factors such as increased literacy and the affordability of magazines and newspapers. In the 19th century, it gained momentum alongside the rapid advancement of the entertainment industries and the influence of technologies like radio, cinema and television. Nowadays, through social media, anyone can become a celebrity, including preachers.</p>
        <p>We have entered an epoch where many are lured to seek the pleasure, approval and admiration of billions of people. It is no wonder that in <i>Sunan Ibn Majah</i> 4204, Rasulullah ﷺ stated that he fears <b>Minor Shirk</b> upon his nation, more than the Antichrist. And when he said this nation will follow Ahlul Kitab inch by inch in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7320, he literally meant in every way, including the adoption of celebrity culture, even among preachers. As this culture has been rooted since its re-emergence, subsequent generations no longer regard it as a threat. If many religious figures start to pursue fame and wealth, next generation will regard it as an honorable pursuit. This is contrary! When Prophet Muhammad ﷺ came, he transformed all <b>worldly intentions</b> present in the khutaba of Jahiliyyah era into <b>ikhlas</b>. He turned preachers into true scholars.</p>
