        <p>It is incorrect to view this authentic* hadith or any narratives about fitan as mere conveyors of distressing news. Instead, they illuminate a path of guidance. This crucial truth applies particularly to this athar: primarily, Allah’s trials never transcend His servants’ capabilities. The khabar showcases how Allah’s judgements adapt to diverse eras and circumstances – a manifestation of His boundless mercy, echoing what is stated in Verse 286 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>“Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity.”</b> At the end of times, a period marked by the weakening of Islam, the surge of ignorance, sinfulness, and oppression, and a decrease in the faithful supporters; it is essential to recognize that Muslims will be pardoned for shortcomings. However, this leniency is attributed to their inherent limitations, not negligence on their part.</p>
<p class="small-text">*The hadith was graded as Sahih/Authentic by Al-Albani (RH) in <i>Al-Silsilah as-Sahihah</i> 2510.</p>
        <p>The second guidance relates to the Messenger ﷺ's emphasis on the proliferation of preachers compared to scholars at the twilight of times. Gaining insights from the utterance of ‘Ali (RA) in <i>Sunan ad-Darimi</i> 261 and Anas ibn Malik (RA) in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7068, the ratio of preachers to scholars could potentially extend even to 90-10 percent. <b>الله أعلم</b>. Furthermore, this highlights their distinct roles, particularly in an era where societal shifts blur the lines between the two. However, this distinction does not negate the fact that some preachers do possess scholarly attributes. To understand the consequences of the abundance of preachers and scarcity of scholars on the ummah today, our thorough exploration begins with the origin of <b>“الخطباء.”</b> Join me as we travel back in time.</p>
<h3>The Origin of “Khutaba”</h3>
        <p>In the context of ancient Arabia, a khatib assumed the mantle of a prominent tribal spokesperson during the era of Jahiliyyah and the early stages of Islam. His role was to impart exhortations and admonishments, known as khutbah, from the pulpit; which encompassed various forms of expression, including sermon, speech, oration, or discourse, often recited in rhyming prose. Despite the term “prose,” most of the khutbahs incorporated poetic elements for impact. The khutbah’s roots are believed to trace back to the utterances of the khatib, who skillfully employed beautiful prose to celebrate the virtues and the achievements of their tribe members while disparaging the weaknesses and the losses of their adversaries. This tradition offered a very effective platform for conveying important messages and also rallying tribal sentiment.</p>
        <p>The arrival of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ heralded a transformative elevation and revolutionization of the old khutbah. This evolution entailed a shift from a role that once fueled tribal animosity through preaching to that of a leader who actively promotes unity under one religion. Also, the transition extended from the communication of tribe-specific messages to the diffusion of universally beneficial knowledge. Further transformation was seen in the approach, as it evolved from relying on eloquent prose based on personal opinions and human ideas to embracing distinct guidance rooted in the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah. These radical shifts, embraced and exemplified by the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ, have shaped the khutbah into what we recognize today.</p>

<p class="small-text">*“Mulkan Jabariyyan”, reported by Ahmad & Abu Dawud, graded Sahih by Al-Albani in <i>Al-Silsilah as-Sahihah</i> 1/34 no. 5.</p>

<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“A man who acquired knowledge and imparted it to others and recited the Quran will be brought forward. Allah will make him recount His blessings, and he will admit to enjoying them in his lifetime. Then Allah will ask, “What did you do in return?”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>He will respond, “I acquired knowledge, disseminated it, and recited the Quran seeking Your pleasure.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>But Allah will say, “You have lied! You acquired knowledge only to be called a scholar, and you recited the Quran only to be known as a qari, and such has been said.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Orders will then be passed against him, and he will be dragged with his face downward and cast into the Fire.”</b></p>
