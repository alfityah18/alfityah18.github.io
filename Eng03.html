        <p>It is incorrect to view this authentic* hadith or any narratives about fitan as mere conveyors of distressing news. Instead, they illuminate a path of guidance. This crucial truth applies particularly to this athar: primarily, Allah’s trials never transcend His servants’ capabilities. The khabar showcases how Allah’s judgements adapt to diverse eras and circumstances – a manifestation of His boundless mercy, echoing what is stated in Verse 286 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>“Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity.”</b> At the end of times, a period marked by the weakening of Islam, the surge of ignorance, sinfulness, and oppression, and a decrease in the faithful supporters; it is essential to recognize that Muslims will be pardoned for shortcomings. However, this leniency is attributed to their inherent limitations, not negligence on their part.</p>
<p class="small-text">*The hadith was graded as Sahih/Authentic by Al-Albani (RH) in <i>Al-Silsilah as-Sahihah</i> 2510.</p>

<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“A man who acquired knowledge and imparted it to others and recited the Quran will be brought forward. Allah will make him recount His blessings, and he will admit to enjoying them in his lifetime. Then Allah will ask, “What did you do in return?”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>He will respond, “I acquired knowledge, disseminated it, and recited the Quran seeking Your pleasure.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>But Allah will say, “You have lied! You acquired knowledge only to be called a scholar, and you recited the Quran only to be known as a qari, and such has been said.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Orders will then be passed against him, and he will be dragged with his face downward and cast into the Fire.”</b></p>
