        <p>It is incorrect to view this authentic* hadith or any narratives about fitan as mere conveyors of distressing news. Every revelation is guidance, and the hadith of fitan has already been understood as a specific guide for the people of the end times. The first guidance from this hadith is a reminder that Allah’s trials never transcend His servants’ capabilities, as He affirms in Verse 286 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>“Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity.”</b> The khabar showcases how Allah’s judgements adapt to diverse eras and circumstances. At the end of times, a period marked by the weakening of Islam, the surge of ignorance, sinfulness, and oppression, and a decrease in the faithful supporters; it is essential to recognize that Muslims will be pardoned for shortcomings. However, this leniency is attributed to their inherent limitations, not negligence on their part.</p>
<p class="small-text">*The hadith was graded as Sahih/Authentic by Al-Albani (RH) in <i>Al-Silsilah as-Sahihah</i> 2510.</p>
        <p>The second guidance relates to the Messenger ﷺ's emphasis on the proliferation of preachers compared to scholars at the twilight of times. Gaining insights from the utterance of ‘Ali (RA) in <i>Sunan ad-Darimi</i> 261 and Anas ibn Malik (RA) in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7068, the ratio of preachers to scholars could potentially extend even to 9:1. <b>الله أعلم</b>. Furthermore, this highlights their distinct roles, particularly in an era where societal shifts blur the lines between the two. However, this distinction does not negate the fact that some preachers do possess scholarly attributes. If we assess the definitions of these two roles purely based on their usage in the present era, we will not observe any significant distinction. To understand the consequences of the abundance of preachers and scarcity of scholars on the ummah today, our thorough exploration begins with the origin of <b>“الخطباء.”</b> Join me as we travel back in time.</p>
<h3>The Origin of “Khutaba”</h3>
        <p>In the context of ancient Arabia, a khatib assumed the mantle of a prominent tribal spokesperson during the era of Jahiliyyah and the early stages of Islam. His role was to impart exhortations and admonishments, known as khutbah, from the pulpit; which encompassed various forms of expression, including sermon, speech, oration, or discourse, often recited in rhyming prose, and also mixed with verses of poetry. The "khutbah’s" roots are believed to trace back to the utterances of the khatib, who skillfully employed beautiful prose to celebrate the virtues and the achievements of their tribe members while disparaging the weaknesses and the losses of their adversaries. This tradition offered a very effective platform for conveying important messages and also rallying tribal sentiment.</p>
        <p>The arrival of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ heralded a transformative elevation and revolutionization of the old khutbah. This evolution entailed a shift from a role that once fueled tribal animosity through preaching to that of a leader who actively promotes unity under one religion. Also, the transition extended from the communication of tribe-specific messages to the diffusion of universally beneficial knowledge. Further transformation was seen in the approach, as it evolved from relying on eloquent prose based on personal opinions and human ideas to embracing distinct guidance rooted in the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah. These radical shifts, embraced and exemplified by the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ, have shaped the khutbah into what we recognize today.</p>
<h3>Contrasting Attributes: Khutaba vs Ulama</h3>
<h3>1. Role</h3>
        <p>It is evident that the distinction between preachers and scholars mentioned in the hadith is indicative of the historical context of that time. Extracting insights from this context, we can connect these differences to our era. At first glance, the roles of preachers and scholars may appear similar – in general, to guide this ummah toward goodness: impart what Allah has made obligatory upon them, and warn against what He has prohibited for them. However, history teaches us a distinctive aspect. <b>If one assumes a role that divides this ummah – they do not deserve to be called alim</b>, regardless of whether they hold a doctorate because they merely went back to what Rasulullah ﷺ had changed. Unaware, <b>they are playing the role of preachers during the period of Jahiliyyah</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Fanaticism</b> was the catalyst for social divisions during those times, and the same holds true today. While divisions in the past were among tribes, now they extend not only among those deviant sects, but also within Ahlu Sunnah itself; <b>sectarian fanaticism</b> has emerged within schools of jurisprudence, theology, methodologies, and even reform movements. Surely, intolerance can lead to hateful actions and behaviours. When such preachers embrace such a stance, they not only have the potential to influence their own followers, but also, unwittingly, to foster extremists and takfiris, which undoubtedly worsens the situation. Fanaticism not only weakens this ummah but also erodes the civilization built by the Prophet ﷺ. It is no wonder that we are still caught up in the grip of the Order of Tyranny* era. Achieving unity requires that we wholeheartedly take crucial steps to adopt <b>moderation</b>, a profound wisdom taught by Verse 125 of Surah an-Nahl.</p>
<p class="small-text">*“Mulkan Jabariyyan”, reported by Ahmad & Abu Dawud, graded Sahih by Al-Albani in <i>Al-Silsilah as-Sahihah</i> 1/34 no. 5.</p>
<h4>ٱدْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِٱلْحِكْمَةِ وَٱلْمَوْعِظَةِ ٱلْحَسَنَةِۖ وَجَٰدِلْهُم بِٱلَّتِى هِىَ أَحْسَنُۚ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and kind advice, and argue with them in the best manner.</b></p>
        <p>On the contrary, a scholar follows in the footsteps initiated by Nabi ﷺ and continued by the Companions – uniting the ummah, across diverse schools; recognizing the differences within Ahlu Sunnah as an advantage to enhance understanding in this religion. In line with the statement of Abu Darda (RA) in <i>Sunan ad-Darimi</i> 295 which asserts that true scholars are those who put their knowledge into practice, they exemplify the teaching of Verse 103 of Surah aal-e-‘Imran: <b>“And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together, and do not be divided,”</b> while also complying with the caution of their Lord, The Exalted in Might in Verse 85 of Surah al-Baqarah: <b>“So do you believe in some of the Scripture and reject the rest?”</b> Those who genuinely embody <b>الْخَشْيَةُ</b>**, a distinct quality among scholars stated in Verse 28 of Surah Fatir; undoubtedly possess compassion towards the community, understand their conditions in the end times, and have a deep love for unity. Unfortunately, their numbers are diminishing.</p>

<h3>2. Intention</h3>
        <p>Captivated by the fame and riches of one celebrity preacher, X was inspired to delve into religious studies. This led him to pursue education at an Islamic university in the Arabian Peninsula. After obtaining his degree, by emulating his icon, he turned into a celebrity preacher himself. He began to hold his knowledge in high regard, deeming himself more intelligent, insightful, and even more educated than others. He harnessed his acquired knowledge to contend with the ulama, debate those less informed, and captivate attention by demonstrating his mastery in memorizing the Quran, Hadith, and scholarly works. After gaining fame and wealth, he ceased to seek further knowledge, convinced that he possessed enough. His followers hailed him as a renowned scholar. And so, he lives contentedly, savoring all the respect and praise.</p>
        <p>In this fictional story, which part of X’s journey do you believe he did wrong? The most obvious is when he became arrogant about his acquired knowledge. As stated in <i>Musnad Abi Ya’la</i> 6698, Rasulullah ﷺ said that: <b>“They are among you from this ummah, and they are the fuel for the Hellfire.”</b> But not everyone knows that  apart from pursuing beneficial knowledge, every aspect of X appears to be misguided, right from the start. The love of fame marks the inception of all evil. X embarked on his journey with fame and wealth, clearly displaying worldly intentions, a path that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ cautioned against in <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 3664: <b>“Whoever acquires knowledge that should be sought seeking the pleasure of Allah (AWJ), but acquires it only to gain some worldly advantage, will not experience the fragrance of Paradise.”</b> X should have known this better.</p>
        <p>Even though he already possessed knowledge, X made no effort to correct his ill intentions; in fact, they grew worse. His routine of criticizing scholars, arguing with the ignorant, and seeking the limelight served as reasons for Allah (SWT) to admit him into the Hellfire, as conveyed in the words of Rasulullah ﷺ in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2654. Despite being hailed as a scholar by the public, his obsession with his own knowledge revealed that he was, in fact, a jahil. This sentiment echoes the words of Masruq ibn al-Ajda’ (RH) in <i>Sunan ad-Darimi</i> 385. And his decision to cease seeking knowledge does not align with the qualities of a true scholar. For in <i>Jami’ at-Tirmidhi</i> 2686, the Prophet ﷺ stated: <b>“The believer will never be satisfied with goodness he hears, until he ends up in Paradise.”</b> The ending of X's story may seem like a good ending, but there is a twist. The true ending for someone like X is as described in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 1905, in the hereafter. Rasul ﷺ said:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“A man who acquired knowledge and imparted it to others and recited the Quran will be brought forward. Allah will make him recount His blessings, and he will admit to enjoying them in his lifetime. Then Allah will ask, “What did you do in return?”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>He will respond, “I acquired knowledge, disseminated it, and recited the Quran seeking Your pleasure.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>But Allah will say, “You have lied! You acquired knowledge only to be called a scholar, and you recited the Quran only to be known as a qari, and such has been said.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Orders will then be passed against him, and he will be dragged with his face downward and cast into the Fire.”</b></p>
        <p>X's downfall began with the influence of <b>celebrity culture</b>. Famous individuals have existed since the time of the first man: the Messengers, their Companions, the Successors, scholars, kings, politicians, authors, artists, sportsmen, and many others. They were famous, yet not all of them sought fame or wealth, especially the believers. And the concept of celebrity culture has been present since ancient civilizations. Modern celebrity culture re-emerged in the 18th century, driven by factors such as increased literacy and the affordability of magazines and newspapers. In the 19th century, it gained momentum alongside the rapid advancement of the entertainment industries and the influence of technologies like radio, cinema and television. Nowadays, through social media, anyone can become a celebrity, including preachers.</p>
        <p>We have already entered an era where the temptation to seek attention, praise, and even the approval of others has become even more intense. It is no wonder that in <i>Sunan Ibn Majah</i> 4204, Rasulullah ﷺ stated that he fears <b>Minor Shirk</b> upon his nation, more than the Antichrist. And when he said this nation will follow Ahlul Kitab inch by inch in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7320, he literally meant in every way, including the adoption of celebrity culture, even among preachers.</p> 
        <p>As this culture has been rooted since its re-emergence, subsequent generations no longer regard it as a threat. If many religious figures start to pursue fame and wealth, next generation will regard it as an honorable pursuit. This is contrary! Verily, when Prophet Muhammad ﷺ came, he abolished the culture of celebrity that existed among the khutaba of the Jahiliyyah era, and transformed all <b>worldly intentions</b> into <b>ikhlas</b>. He turned preachers into true scholars.</p>
 <p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>       
        <p>In addition to the two guidances mentioned in the introduction, this hadith also serves as a reminder not to be naive about the realities of worldly life – not all religious figures are scholars; indeed, not all are honest, true, and wise. Through Verse 2-3 of Surah al-Insan, Allah (SWT) explains that one of the purposes of our creation is to be tested, and thus we are given two choices – whether to follow the straight path or to deviate. Hence, religious figures also fall into these two categories. From rabbis and priests of the People of the Book who alter the laws of Allah, to the Hypocrites who feigned belief during the time of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, to the Innovators who emerged since the era of the Companions (RA) up to the present – misguided religious figures will always exist until the end of this temporal realm. This is the reality. Therefore, let us heed the details provided by Rasulullah ﷺ himself in <i>Musnad ash-Shamiyyin</i> 588, which has been deemed sahih by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (RH):</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“This knowledge will be upheld by the just across generations. They will protect it from the distortion of the extremists, the misrepresentation of the fabricators, and the interpretation of the ignorants.”</b></p>

<h3>Contrasting Attributes: Khutaba vs Ulama</h3>
<h3>3. Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Imagine two clear bottles placed side by side. From a distance, they appear identical, each containing a clear, transparent liquid. However, only upon closer inspection—through smell or taste—can you discern their true nature. One bottle holds pure water, quenching thirst and sustaining life. The other bottle contains rubbing alcohol, which, despite its pristine appearance, projects a pungent odour and is harmful if ingested. Such is the analogy of the marfu’ hadith above. Broadly speaking, most of the bearers of religious knowledge either appear to base their knowledge on the Quran and Hadith or explicitly claim to do so. In reality, they are divided into two groups: only one is authentic, while the others deceive and bring harm; only one is true scholars, while the others are akin to the preachers of the age of Jahiliyyah.</p>
        <p>Beyond <b>depth of knowledge</b>, another aspect that distinguishes true scholars from impostors is <b>how they approach religious knowledge</b>. Genuine scholars are <b>fair, honest, upright, and faithful to the Quran and Hadith</b>: they preserve these texts as they were revealed, inherited, and practised by the earliest generations, even safeguarding them from any form of corruption. Unlike worldly knowledge, which undergoes evolution, divine knowledge is already perfect, as stated by Allah (AWJ) in Verse 3 of Surah al-Maidah. Thus, something that has already attained a state of perfection risks disruption of its equilibrium and potential destruction if manipulated. As mentioned in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 1920, they will always be triumphant on the path of truth, and they are akin to the bottle that holds pure water required by this ummah.</p>
        <p>On the path of falsehood, there exist three groups of the Jahiliyyah-era preachers, regardless of their titles, certificates, influence, or even position. The first group comprises the <b>ghuluw</b> who tarnish the moderation of the way of life established by Allah. They result in ruin not only to matters of ibadah but also to aqidah, potentially leading to the collapse of Tawhid, as indicated in Verse 77 of Surah al-Maidah. The second group consists of <b>liars</b> who treat religious knowledge as if it originates from them, prioritizing intellect, interpreting the Quran according to their desires, fabricating Hadith, using dreams and the words of figures that contradict the words of Allah and the sayings of His Messenger as arguments, and even inventing practices. And the third group is made up of the <b>unintelligent</b> and those with <b>darkened hearts</b>—camel calves being milked, lacking understanding, and failing to apply their knowledge—disseminating inaccuracies.</p>
        <p>However, differentiating those two bottles is not as straightforward as one might think. Through different texts in <i>Silsilah as-Sahihah</i> 3189 below, to distinguish knowledge in an era where true scholars are scarce and preachers are abundant, Rasulullah ﷺ explained that the <b>sensor</b> one must possess is the <b>divine knowledge that enlightens the heart</b>. Nothing can evaluate knowledge except knowledge itself. This is crucial at a time when knowledge is becoming corrupted, and people start to regard preachers as scholars. Moreover, to be protected by Allah, knowledge must be pursued with <b>ikhlas</b>, as stated in Verse 40 of Surah al-Hijr. Those who practice knowledge can taste the difference between the bottles. Those who seek knowledge can smell their distinction. Those who disregard knowledge are prone to deception.</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“You are living in an era abundant with fuqaha yet scarce in khutaba. There are few beggars, yet many givers. Practicing deeds at this time is better than possessing knowledge.”</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>“A time will come when fuqaha are scarce and khutaba are abundant. There will be many beggars, but few givers. Possessing knowledge at that time will be better than practicing deeds.”</b></p>
<h3>4. Akhlaq</h3>
        <p>When our mother ‘Aisyah (RA), through <i>Mishkat ul-Masabih</i> 1257, concluded that the character of the Prophet ﷺ was the Quran: scholars, the inheritors of the Prophets, should exemplify the finest character of their era, becoming pioneers in the compilation of manners, ethics, and all virtues advocated in the Book of Allah. However, as understood from ‘Umar (RA) in <i>Sunan al-Kubra</i> 20400, a person’s public persona does not really reflect their true character at home, as character can be performed for influence, as Rasulullah ﷺ remarked in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2986. Nevertheless, we can discern their true nature through their <b>patience</b>, <b>caution</b>, and <b>humility</b> in educating this ummah, reflecting <b>true understanding</b>, as true understanding is a sign of being chosen by Allah, in line with the saying of An-Nabi ﷺ in <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 1037.</p>
<h3>7 Characteristics of a Faqih</h3>
        <p>1. <b>Does not hastily issue fatwas</b> as “the most hasty in issuing fatwas is the quickest to enter Hellfire” and because “haste is from Satan”;</p>
        <p>2. <b>Does not issue fatwas based on merely personal reasoning, or without basis, or making the forbidden permissible and otherwise with vague reasoning</b> without guidance from the Quran and the Sunnah;</p>
        <p>3. <b>Resolves issues according to a hierarchical order of reference</b>: the Quran, the Sunnah of Rasulullah ﷺ, consensus (of the Companions), and ijtihad;</p>
        <p>4. <b>Postpones new issues</b> to consult experts, hold discussions, or conduct thorough research first, as “delaying is better”;</p>
        <p>5. <b>Refrains from issuing fatwas for every question</b>, as those who do so “are only the insane”;</p>
        <p>6. <b>Does not force oneself to give answers or pretend to know</b> when lacking knowledge on an issue;</p>
        <p>7. <b>Responds with “Allah knows best” to questions that are unknown</b>, as admitting “I do not know” is a part of knowledge and a sign of sincerity, not pretence.</p>

<h3>5. Aqidah</h3>
        <p>In <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 7084, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ explained that following an era tainted with wickedness, during which deviant sects would emerge, there would come a time when some preachers would invite people to Jahannam. This signifies that after the emergence of the seventy-two misguided sects, as mentioned by the Prophet ﷺ in <i>Sunan Ibn Majah</i> 3992, an era would arise where the doctrines of these sects—originating from the six primary groups: Rafidhah, Haruriyyah, Jahmiyyah, Murjiah, Qadariyyah, and Jabriyyah—would be spread publicly and extensively. We are arguably in that phase now, perhaps even at its peak. Today, on social media, without any theological censorship, anyone can become a preacher and disseminate any form of teaching. Hence, the ummah is profoundly exposed to significant danger.</p>
        <p>Moreover, it is even more concerning when we learn from <i>Musnad ash-Shamiyyin</i> 588 that these sects are not only capable of overstepping boundaries, lying, and misinterpreting the Quran and Hadith, but they can also do the same to the established madhhabs of Ahlu Sunnah by pretending to be part of one of the madhhabs. When their corrupt teachings have long been profoundly embedded in the minds of the people, efforts at remedy will often be rejected and resisted, since their deceits are perceived as the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This is the sad reality mentioned by Rasulullah ﷺ in <i>Sahih at-Targhib</i> 111. That is why, as mentioned in <i>Al-Muwatta’</i> 1661, he reminded his followers to hold firmly to the Quran and Sunnah, so they can separate the wheat from the chaff, discerning between the genuine and the false.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that preachers who lead people to Hellfire can be divided into two types: those who call to a temporary punishment and those who call to an eternal one. No corruption of aqidah is more frightening than the destruction of <b>Tawhid</b>. The same problem that plagued previous ummahs and some segment of this ummah is the extreme adoration for pious individuals. In <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 3873, Rasulullah ﷺ mentioned that they will be resurrected as the worst of creatures on the Day of Resurrection. Their modus operandi involves worshipping at the graves of the pious, praying to them, and seeking help from their souls, which they claim are close to Allah (SWT). This ignorance has been ongoing since the time of Prophet Noah (AS), as detailed in Verse 23 of Surah Nuh, and it is the primary subterfuge and mission of Iblis.</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether a person is born a Muslim, or their good deeds are as high as the mountains, if one dies committing <b>Major Shirk</b> such as those, all their deeds will be shown before their eyes and disappear like dust in the wind, as described in Verse 23 of Surah al-Furqan. Subsequently, they will be cast into Jahannam to suffer eternally, for, as stated by Allah in Verse 48 of Surah an-Nisa, He will never forgive the sin of associating partners with Him. So, how can such preachers exist? In addition to Verse 2-3 of Surah al-Insan cited earlier, the answer is also present in Verse 76 of Surah az-Zukhruf: it is their own choice. The detachment of society from understanding the contents of the Quran and listening to the Sunnah, not recognising the true aqidah of the four major madhhabs, and treating religion merely as a tradition or imitation are among the reasons some are deceived.</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">* * *</p>
        <p>It is very important for us to prioritise knowledge from esteemed scholars over preachers. This principle is underscored by Ibn Mas’ud (RA), who is quoted in <i>Az-Zuhd wal-Raqa’iq</i> 801, stating that we will continue to be in a good state as long as we seek knowledge from the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ and the great scholars of Islam, whether from the past or present. However, when the ummah begins to seek knowledge from the young, that is when we are on the path to ruin. The increase in the Jahiliyyah-era preachers and the decline of genuine scholars will only fulfil other prophetic warnings, such as those found in <i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 100, where people appoint ignorant individuals as their sources of religious knowledge. In this era of widespread trials and tribulations, be cautious about from whom we seek knowledge. Scholars are gradually being taken away from us; recognise and learn from them while there are still some among us. Life is a test; strive to answer it correctly.</p>
