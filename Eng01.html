            This narration* holds remarkable significance. It tells the story of Angel Gabriel (AS) who visited Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to teach us the most essential aspects of living a religious life, such as how to become a Muslim, a Mu’min, or attain the highest status of a Muhsin. All of which can’t be complete without taking into account the importance of knowledge of fitan. And Allah (SWT) placed two incredibly significant signs of as-Sa'ah in our time, in this highly critical hadith. Does it indicate that the end of times is proximate? Most certainly... Does it indicate that the phase of minor signs is approaching its end? الله أعلم. [*The full hadith is longer; refer to Sahih Muslim.] 

The Signs Have Been Realized

In 1966, a collaboration between Patrick Steptoe, a gynecologist & Sir Robert Edwards, an embryologist from Britain, gave rise to the revolutionary technology of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). This pioneering feat was first witnessed in the birth of Louise Brown, the world's first test-tube baby, on July 25, 1978. Yet, this success also paved the way for a more controversial procedure. On August 1, 1985, Shannon Boff, a housewife from the USA, became the first surrogate mother to receive remuneration for carrying the sperm and egg of another couple, in effect becoming a servant who gave birth to her master or mistress... 

In Musnad Ahmad no. 2926, it is written that the Prophet ﷺ explained that the goat herders referred to the Arab people. In 1932, the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia demanded novel sources of revenue beyond the customary Hajj & Umrah pilgrimages. Then, in 1938, the Dammam No. 7 oil well transformed the once-destitute dry peninsula into the world's largest petroleum source, triggering an architectural race for grandeur... With newfound wealth came the pursuit of taller and even more elaborate buildings, and the Dubai World Trade Centre claimed the distinction of being the first skyscraper in the Middle East upon its unveiling on February 26, 1979. And the race for architectural supremacy continues to this day. 

The two signs mentioned in the Hadith of Gabriel have been occurring together for the past 45 years, considering the year IVF technology succeeded and the construction of the tallest building in the Arabia at that time. Science and technology have long been beneficial to us, humanity – from ancient times to the present day. However, the two signs in the hadith serve as a warning to be cautious of their fitna: science's ability to change human nature, and technology's tendency to make people more engrossed in worldly pleasures. 

While identifying the fitna present in science and technology, such as IVF, is somewhat straightforward, the rapid and pervasive advancements that have become an integral part of our way of life can effortlessly make us complacent. Without many realizing it, the presence of artificial intelligence (AI) including computers and smartphones, has subtly altered human nature, causing individuals to become progressively mesmerized with worldly desires. In effect, it has become a predator that preys on the weak souls... As stated by Muhammad The Chosen One ﷺ in Jami' at-Tirmidhi, hadith no. 2181: 

لاَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى تُكَلِّمَ السِّبَاعُ الإِنْسَ

"Before the Hour strikes, a time will come when the 'predatory beings' will converse with mankind..." 

Many have fallen victim to its powerful grasp – spending excessive amounts of time under its captivity;  familial ties wane as virtual relationships gain traction; social skills wither, and health issues abound, especially among children; opportunities to indulge in sinful acts are at one's fingertips; even new predators like ChatGPT have claimed some job opportunities. But Islam is not a stagnant way of life in the passage of time. The predator is like a mighty lion... with strength and wisdom, it can be conquered, tamed, and its benefits reaped. 

The Separation of the World and the Hereafter

Verse 7 of Surah ar-Rum and Sahih Muslim 2722 categorizes knowledge into 2 types: beneficial, divinely inspired knowledge like Al-Quran and As-Sunnah, and knowledge linked to it, or parallel with their messages; and the other type lacks such connections or any linkage at all. Therefore, controversies around certain areas of science and technology emerge due to ideas that have nothing to do with divine guidance and innovations that are disengaged from its messages. These creations were originally intended merely for worldly benefit, with no consideration for spiritual gain. This problem dates back to the 500 years of European colonialism... In Sunan Abi Dawud hadith 4297, our beloved Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

يُوشِكُ الأُمَمُ أَنْ تَدَاعَى عَلَيْكُمْ كَمَا تَدَاعَى الأَكَلَةُ إِلَى قَصْعَتِهَا.‏ 
فَقَالَ قَائِلٌ وَمِنْ قِلَّةٍ نَحْنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ قَالَ بَلْ أَنْتُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ كَثِيرٌ وَلَكِنَّكُمْ غُثَاءٌ كَغُثَاءِ السَّيْلِ وَلَيَنْزِعَنَّ اللَّهُ مِنْ صُدُورِ عَدُوِّكُمُ الْمَهَابَةَ مِنْكُمْ وَلَيَقْذِفَنَّ اللَّهُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمُ الْوَهَنَ.‏ فَقَالَ قَائِلٌ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ 
وَمَا الْوَهَنُ قَالَ حُبُّ الدُّنْيَا وَكَرَاهِيَةُ الْمَوْتِ.‏
"Verily, foreign nations are about to                swarm upon you, like a feast to its platter." 
One inquired: 
"Is this due to our being outnumbered?" 
To this, the Prophet ﷺ replied: 
"No, you will indeed be many.                                But you will be like scum and rubbish             carried away by a torrent. And Allah shall      banish fear from the hearts of your foes, while within your own, an enervation shall prevail." 
One asked: 
"What is enervation, O Messenger of Allah?" 
He retorted: 
"Love for this world and hatred for death."

Although the term "secularism" may have been coined by 19th-century British reformist, George Jacob Holyoake, its consequences were warned of over 1,400 years ago by the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. The roots of this concept can be traced back to historical events such as the French Revolution, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Thirty Years' War. And the story of the people of Midian, recorded in Verse 87 of Hud, also illustrates this principle: charged with economic oppression, they mockingly questioned the role of religion in commercial affairs. From these historical and religious contexts, and what it has done to the world today, we’ve witnessed the development and the unfortunate consequences of the principle of separating religion from worldly matters. 

The Traps and Losses of the Ummah

Colonialism not only confiscated wealth but also imposed its own long-term framework on our thoughts. Secularism has been proven to perpetuate the same issue as in Verse 87 of Surah Hud: economic oppression from capitalism, while also promoting its patriarch: a libertine lifestyle, known as liberalism, that endorses other tenets such as pluralism. Consequently, a generation enamored with the temporal realm has been born, overlooking the spiritual importancy. This has been planted through the greatest deception: their education system – a factory that has produced Muslims who, despite inheriting and succeeding, inadvertently propagate the echoes of their former oppressors. 

While actively pursuing worldly knowledge, the vast majority of this group has not fully appreciated the implications of adopting Western paradigms of thought, lifestyle, and conduct. Despite the inclusion of religious teachings, they are usually presented as peripheral and lacking the necessary depth to make an indelible impact. This is reflected in the fact that many alumni of this educational system or its equivalent have become non-observant Muslims. However, is it sufficient for only a small group to seek divine knowledge for the progress of Islam? Let us reflect on the words of Rasulullah ﷺ in Sahih Muslim 2526: 

تَجِدُونَ النَّاسَ مَعَادِنَ فَخِيَارُهُمْ فِي الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ 
خِيَارُهُمْ فِي الإِسْلاَمِ إِذَا فَقُهُوا

"You shall find humankind akin to       MINERALS, with the best among you during       the era of ignorance being the best among you   even after embracing Islam, if only granted           an understanding of the faith." 

Human beings are akin to minerals. Just as gold retains its value even when used in worldly pursuits; lead, despite being elevated to the sphere of religious affairs, cannot become gold due to its innate, inherent and different nature and value. Similarly, individuals born with low IQs or without natural leadership abilities can’t become geniuses or great leaders, no matter how much they strive to do so... As a result, when the vast majority are focused on pursuing worldly knowledge, the high-quality minerals that remain for the acquisition of divine knowledge inevitably dwindle. 

The segregation has produced intellectuals who specialize only in worldly or religious knowledge, but not both, as was common in the early generations and their successors. This represents a great loss, as we have failed to produce individuals of "platinum" caliber, such as 'Umar (RA), who served as the "president" of the state, and was also a scholar, jurist, and mufti. Similarly, there are a handful "diamonds" like Ibn Khaldun (RH), who excelled in numerous fields such as history, sociology, astronomy, and chemistry. Unfortunately, the European education system, or its influence, has rendered us weak and subservient to their deviant principles. 

Returning to Prophethood 

With the ever-evolving challenges of the modern era, there is no surer way to fortify the ummah than by going back to the tried-and-true system of education exemplified by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This system centers on the Quran and Sunnah as the foundation for learning, before branching out into specialized fields. Its focus is on nurturing true Muslimin, Mu’minin, and Muhsinin before they embark on their paths as doctors, merchants, policeman, educators, or leaders... It instills within individuals the strength of religious conviction and the wisdom of divine revelation, empowering them to confront the complex demands of this scientific and technological age. 

By immersing ourselves at all levels in the Quran and Sunnah, we can not only excavate the high-quality minerals for healthier religious education competition; but also bridge the divide among Ahlu-Sunnah. Experts with deep religious understanding can stabilize political, economic and social infrastructures; and even spearhead scientific and technological advancements that preserve human nature and sustain the Islamic way of life for the afterlife. As the first five revelations, Al-‘Alaq, centered on knowledge – the restoration process must start with education. Similar to the Quran's gradual revelation over 23 years, the change must be gradual and patient. Begin small, with the family institution. Each leader, including parents, will be accountable for how they carry out their Allah-given responsibility... Hence, gently counsel your government and initiate at the grassroots level. 

إِنْ شَاءَ اللّٰهُ
