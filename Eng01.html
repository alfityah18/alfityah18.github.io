        <p>The full scope of how the Covid pandemic changed our world may not be clear for another generation. The deluge of official inquiries, political brawls, think pieces, and books (I wrote one) that have come out in the past few years are first drafts. They’re also reminders of how complex the pandemic was to live through, and how intense experiences can generate powerful insights. I periodically revisit this post I wrote in May 2020, because it puts me back in that strange time and reminds me what we could potentially learn from it. I hope we never go through another world crisis like the Covid pandemic, but even more, I hope we don’t forget its lessons. Some of which I discuss here. Best wishes for a safe and happy close to 10,000.</p>
