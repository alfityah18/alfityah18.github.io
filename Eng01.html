        <p>This narration* holds remarkable significance. It tells the story of Angel Gabriel (AS) who visited Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to teach us the most essential aspects of living a religious life, such as how to become a <b>Muslim</b>, a <b>Mu’min</b>, or attain the highest status of a <b>Muhsin</b>. All of which can’t be complete without taking into account the importance of <b>knowledge of fitan</b>. And Allah (SWT) placed two incredibly significant signs of the Hour in our time, in this highly critical hadith. Does it indicate that the end of times is proximate? Most certainly. Does it indicate that the phase of minor signs is approaching its end? <b>الله أعلم</b>.</p>
<p class="small-text">*The full hadith is longer; refer to <i>Sahih Muslim</i>.</p>
<h3>The Signs Have Been Realized</h3>
<p>In 1966, a collaboration between Patrick Steptoe, a gynecologist and Sir Robert Edwards, an embryologist from Britain, gave rise to the revolutionary technology of <b>in vitro fertilisation (IVF)</b>. This pioneering feat was first witnessed in the birth of Louise Brown, the world's first test-tube baby, on <b>July 25, 1978</b>. Yet, this success also paved the way for a more controversial procedure. On <b>August 1, 1985</b>, Shannon Boff, a housewife from the USA, became the first <b>surrogate mother</b> to receive remuneration for carrying the sperm and egg of another couple, in effect becoming a <b>servant</b> who gave birth to her <b>master</b> or <b>mistress</b>.</p>
<p>In <i>Musnad Ahmad</i> 2926, it is written that the Prophet ﷺ explained that the goat herders referred to the Arab people. In 1932, the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia demanded novel sources of revenue beyond the customary Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. Then, in 1938, the Dammam No. 7 oil well transformed the <b>once-destitute dry peninsula</b> into the world's largest petroleum source, triggering an architectural race for grandeur. With newfound wealth came the pursuit of taller and even more elaborate buildings, and the <b>Dubai World Trade Centre</b> claimed the distinction of being the first skyscraper in the Middle East upon its unveiling on <b>February 26, 1979</b>. And the race for architectural supremacy continues to this day.<p/>
<p>The two signs mentioned in the Hadith of Gabriel <b>have been occurring together for the past 45 years</b>, considering the year IVF technology succeeded and the construction of the tallest building in the Arabia at that time. Science and technology have long been beneficial to us, humanity – from ancient times to the present day. However, the two signs in the hadith serve as a warning to be cautious of their fitna: <b>science's ability to change human nature, and technology's tendency to make people more engrossed in worldly pleasures</b>.</p>
<p>While identifying the fitna present in science and technology, such as IVF, is somewhat straightforward, the rapid and pervasive advancements that have become an integral part of our way of life can effortlessly make us complacent. Without many realizing it, the presence of <b>artificial intelligence (AI)</b> including <b>computers</b> and <b>smartphones</b>, has subtly altered human nature, causing individuals to become progressively mesmerized with worldly desires. In effect, it has become a <b>predator</b> that preys on the weak souls. As stated by Muhammad The Chosen One ﷺ in <i>Jami' at-Tirmidhi</i> 2181:</p>
<h4>لاَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى تُكَلِّمَ السِّبَاعُ الإِنْسَ</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>Before the Hour strikes, a time will come when the 'predatory beings' will converse with mankind.</b></p>
<p>Many have fallen victim to its powerful grasp – spending excessive amounts of time under its captivity;  familial ties wane as virtual relationships gain traction; social skills wither, and health issues abound, especially among children; opportunities to indulge in sinful acts are at one's fingertips; even new predators like ChatGPT have claimed some job opportunities. But Islam is not a stagnant way of life in the passage of time. The predator is like a mighty lion, with <b>strength</b> and <b>wisdom</b>, it can be conquered, tamed, and its benefits reaped.</p>
<h3>The Separation of the World and the Hereafter</h3>
<p>Verse 7 of Surah ar-Rum and <i>Sahih Muslim</i> 2722 categorizes knowledge into 2 types: beneficial, divinely inspired knowledge like Al-Quran and As-Sunnah, and knowledge linked to it, or parallel with their messages; and the other type lacks such connections or any linkage at all. Therefore, controversies around certain areas of science and technology emerge due to ideas that have nothing to do with divine guidance and innovations that are disengaged from its messages. These creations were originally intended merely for worldly benefit, with no consideration for spiritual gain. This problem dates back to the <b>500 years of European colonialism</b>. In <i>Sunan Abi Dawud</i> 4297, our beloved Rasulullah ﷺ said:</p>
<h4>Text here</h4>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>"Verily, foreign nations are about to swarm upon you, like a feast to its platter."</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">One inquired:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b><i>"Is this due to our being outnumbered?"</i></b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">To this, the Prophet ﷺ replied:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>"No, you will indeed be many. But you will be like scum and rubbish carried away by a torrent. And Allah shall banish fear from the hearts of your foes, while within your own, an enervation shall prevail."</b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">One asked:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b><i>"What is enervation, O Messenger of Allah?"</i></b></p>
<p class="centered-paragraph">He retorted:</p>
<p class="centered-paragraph"><b>"Love for this world and hatred for death."</b></p>
<p>Although the term <strong>"secularism"</strong> may have been coined by 19th-century British reformist, George Jacob Holyoake, its consequences were warned of over 1,400 years ago by Prophet Muhammad ï·º. The roots of this concept can be traced back to historical events such as the French Revolution, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Thirty Years' War. And the story of the people of Midian, recorded in Verse 87 of Hud, also illustrates this principle: charged with economic oppression, they mockingly questioned the role of religion in commercial affairs. From these historical and religious contexts, and what it has done to the world today, we've witnessed the development and the unfortunate consequences of the principle of <strong>separating religion from worldly matters</strong>.</p>
