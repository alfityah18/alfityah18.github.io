        <p>This narration* holds remarkable significance. It tells the story of Angel Gabriel (AS) who visited Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to teach us the most essential aspects of living a religious life, such as how to become a Muslim, a Mu’min, or attain the highest status of a Muhsin. All of which can’t be complete without taking into account the importance of knowledge of fitan. And Allah (SWT) placed two incredibly significant signs of as-Sa'ah in our time, in this highly critical hadith. Does it indicate that the end of times is proximate? Most certainly... Does it indicate that the phase of minor signs is approaching its end? الله أعلم.</p>
         <p>[*The full hadith is longer; refer to Sahih Muslim.]</p>
         <p>The Signs Have Been Realized</p>
